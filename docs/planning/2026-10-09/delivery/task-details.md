## P00. Scope, baseline, and architecture decisions

An approved implementation contract with no unresolved decision hidden in code.

**Epic acceptance criteria**

- **P00-AC01:** Every accepted user decision and all existing functional groups have a named owner phase and verification scenario.
- **P00-AC02:** Codex reviews the complete plan, decision log, contracts and criterion-level evidence, records its review and advancement decision, and verifies the committed and pushed P00 candidate before P01 starts. Ryan and Nick are not required for delivery approval.
- **P00-AC03:** All P01–P04 blocking choices have recorded alternatives, rationale, and consequences. Later choices have a deadline before their owning phase.
- **P00-AC04:** Baseline checks identify passes, failures, missing environments, and historic-only claims separately.
- **P00-AC05:** The complete source inventory, component reuse decisions and behavior checks are reviewed. Every baseline file and additional governed source file has an owner; unmapped entry points or uncertain behavior are recorded as blocking gaps. No retirement is implied by a launch-scope choice.
- **P00-AC06:** LOCAL-01 has a reviewed host/platform support matrix, stable instance identity, safe Docker context and credential rules, readiness/status contract, and assigned verification owners. Automatic launch is required for every integration advertised as supporting it.

### P00-T01: Freeze df46e94570fadf78ef67a75a692dd48b968a10f7 as the behavioral comparison baseline and inventory every CLI verb, dashboard view, protocol, state store, integration, and evaluation.

**Status:** done. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P00-T06.

**Implementation plan**

1. Pin df46e94570fadf78ef67a75a692dd48b968a10f7 and verify all 338 baseline Git blobs against component-inventory.json; retain later files as additional governed scope.
2. Check each of the four component manifests, the 37 baseline groups, source-surface-index fingerprints, commands, dashboard views/routes, protocols, stores, integrations and evaluation owners. Record uncertain dynamic behavior for maintainer review.
3. Reconcile historical dashboard specifications and instruction changes against current code without replacing historical evidence. Preserve all behavior-check IDs and distinguish static inventory coverage from runtime qualification.
4. Attach inventory results and source-bound checks. Submit the public-entry-point and behavior review to P00-GATE; keep any unresolved completeness gap visible before refactoring.

**Deliverables**

1. Freeze df46e94570fadf78ef67a75a692dd48b968a10f7 as the behavioral comparison baseline and inventory every CLI verb, dashboard view, protocol, state store, integration, and evaluation.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P00-T01-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Freeze df46e94570fadf78ef67a75a692dd48b968a10f7 as the behavioral comparison baseline and inventory every CLI verb, dashboard view, protocol, state store, integration, and evaluation.
2. P00-T01-AC02: Every named capability in the scope has a passing focused check or a recorded, unresolved environment/decision gap. A gap prevents this task being marked done; a smaller successful example cannot stand in for the entire scope.
3. P00-T01-AC03: Affected existing behavior has a baseline/candidate comparison or an approved behavior-change record; no capability, required assertion or stored identity is silently removed.
4. P00-T01-AC04: Evidence identifies the candidate commit, actual environment, command and result for each task criterion; secrets and private agent reasoning are excluded. Known limitations, migration and recovery behavior are documented.

**Verification**

1. Review the traceability matrix and inspect contracts together.
2. Run existing relevant suites on supported environments and reproduce the four reported crash/dispatch defects with isolated fixtures.
3. Record the exact commit, tools, fixtures, and results. Review missing environments as gaps, not passes.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.
5. Review the LOCAL-01 flow and FAIL-55–FAIL-62 against actual host startup capabilities; distinguish approved behavior from unresolved host/version choices.

### P00-T02: Resolve launch workflow, dashboard controls, language/runtime and initial SDKs, storage topology, NATS account/domain layout, supported OS/tool versions, initial scale, identity enrollment, and provider/data policy.

**Status:** done. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P00-T06.

**Implementation plan**

1. Compare Go, Python and TypeScript over the same disposable NATS request/reply fixture, verify absent-service failure, and cross-compile the candidate foundation without treating build success as native-platform evidence.
2. Recommend runtime/SDK pins, protected process placement, repository layout and reuse boundaries. Record alternatives and costs in decisions/runtime-and-deployment.md.
3. Define identity/enrollment, worker isolation, provider/data policy, audience/workflow, retained dashboard controls and capacity test targets. Preserve existing functionality and distinguish proposed support from actual host evidence.
4. Attach exact source/dependency/result hashes and submit D01-D06 for P00 review. Resolve or explicitly assign later-provider/version decisions before their owning implementation begins.

**Deliverables**

1. Resolve launch workflow, dashboard controls, language/runtime and initial SDKs, storage topology, NATS account/domain layout, supported OS/tool versions, initial scale, identity enrollment, and provider/data policy.

### P00-T03: Reproduce or explicitly scope the previously reported federation correctness defects

**Status:** done. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P00-T06.

**Implementation plan**

1. Read AMX-BASE-001 through AMX-BASE-006, their original acceptance text, repair report and upgrade limitations. Verify the old reproduction source is attributable to the frozen baseline.
2. Check SHA-256 identity for all eight repaired runtime/test files and three historical logs. Retain old-source failures and the 119-test broker run as historical evidence rather than rerunning unchanged broad suites.
3. Run ./hub/tests/local.ps1 hub.tests.test_governance in the prepared WSL environment. Retain the result, log, source fingerprints, exit code and any missing coverage.
4. Assign each assertion to P01-T06 and its replacing state, authorization, orchestration or federation task. Keep repository-version, external-artifact and delegated-actor acceptance gaps explicitly open in P05/P10.
5. Record every task criterion with current evidence. Do not change runtime behavior, failure-matrix status or phase acceptance through this scoping task.

**Deliverables**

1. Reproduce or explicitly scope the previously reported federation correctness defects. Turn each into a regression case owned by the replacing phase.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P00-T03-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Reproduce or explicitly scope the previously reported federation correctness defects. Turn each into a regression case owned by the replacing phase.

3. Record the exact commit, tools, fixtures, and results. Review missing environments as gaps, not passes.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.
5. Review the LOCAL-01 flow and FAIL-55–FAIL-62 against actual host startup capabilities; distinguish approved behavior from unresolved host/version choices.

### P00-T04: Approve versioned state machines, authority boundaries, plugin manifest/context schemas, migration ownership, and the requirement-to-phase matrix.

**Status:** done. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P00-T06.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Approve versioned state machines, authority boundaries, plugin manifest/context schemas, migration ownership, and the requirement-to-phase matrix.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.

**Deliverables**

1. Approve versioned state machines, authority boundaries, plugin manifest/context schemas, migration ownership, and the requirement-to-phase matrix.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P00-T04-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Approve versioned state machines, authority boundaries, plugin manifest/context schemas, migration ownership, and the requirement-to-phase matrix.

### P00-T05: Record approved storage direction STATE-01

**Status:** done. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P00-T06.

**Implementation plan**

1. Define independent hub domains and kernel/system/project/agreement account boundaries, with broker-enforced credentials and domain-owner validation.
2. Specify one conditional complete transition record, durable operation identity, recoverable effect intent, lost-reply reconciliation and immutable artifacts; distinguish same-stream atomicity from cross-boundary recovery.
3. Set initial retention, quota/headroom, checkpoint, replica/sync and backup/restore targets for solo/team/offline profiles. Record what source research and configuration validation do and do not prove.
4. Assign concurrency, migration, authorization, replay and fault-model checks to P01/P04/P10/P12; carry every baseline invariant forward. Submit S01-S05 for review without introducing authoritative SQL.

**Deliverables**

1. Record approved storage direction STATE-01. Select JetStream authority boundaries, retention/checkpoint policy, replication/sync profiles, broker/API access scopes and supported SDK versions. Keep any proposed authoritative SQL exception visible for review.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P00-T05-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Record approved storage direction STATE-01. Select JetStream authority boundaries, retention/checkpoint policy, replication/sync profiles, broker/API access scopes and supported SDK versions. Keep any proposed authoritative SQL exception visible for review.
2. P00-T05-AC02: Every named capability in the scope has a passing focused check or a recorded, unresolved environment/decision gap. A gap prevents this task being marked done; a smaller successful example cannot stand in for the entire scope.
3. P00-T05-AC03: Affected existing behavior has a baseline/candidate comparison or an approved behavior-change record; no capability, required assertion or stored identity is silently removed.
4. P00-T05-AC04: Evidence identifies the candidate commit, actual environment, command and result for each task criterion; secrets and private agent reasoning are excluded. Known limitations, migration and recovery behavior are documented.

### P00-T06: Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller

**Status:** done. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** none.

**Implementation plan**

1. Review the phase-owned components in the preservation matrix and identify every changed caller, command, route, state record, integration and UI action; also include cross-phase callers affected by this work.
2. Record retain/wrap/extract/extend/replace decisions with reasons. Map each old assertion and data identity to its target. Capture missing characterization fixtures before refactoring.
3. Run the available baseline checks and define the candidate, migration/rollback and added-functionality checks. Candidate execution belongs to the implementation and final phase gate, so this preparation does not depend on future code being finished.
4. Maintain the inventory and behavior ownership throughout the phase. Missing environments stay open. Codex reviews any capability change against the complete user-authorized scope; autonomy does not permit silent scope reduction.

**Deliverables**

1. Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller. Record reuse, intentional behavior changes, migration needs and the specific added functionality before editing implementation.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P00-T06-AC01: Every phase-owned component and affected cross-phase caller has a recorded scope, existing behavior and owner; no changed source is unmapped.
2. P00-T06-AC02: Baseline evidence distinguishes passing, failing, unavailable and historical results. Any gap that prevents a safe planned change remains blocking.
3. P00-T06-AC03: Reuse and migration decisions name alternatives, preserved IDs/assertions and rollback boundaries; required approval exists before any capability reduction.
4. P00-T06-AC04: Candidate comparison, added-functionality and migration fixtures are assigned to implementation and phase verification tasks. This preflight does not claim that future candidate tests already passed.

**Verification**

1. Review the traceability matrix and inspect contracts together.
2. Run existing relevant suites on supported environments and reproduce the four reported crash/dispatch defects with isolated fixtures.
3. Record the exact commit, tools, fixtures, and results. Review missing environments as gaps, not passes.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.
5. Review the LOCAL-01 flow and FAIL-55–FAIL-62 against actual host startup capabilities; distinguish approved behavior from unresolved host/version choices.

### P00-T07: Record LOCAL-01: automatic Docker Compose startup or verified reuse on supported agent-client launch

**Status:** done. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P00-T06.

**Implementation plan**

1. Specify stable enrolled profile identity, release/context ownership and an OS-held startup lock that works before NATS exists; prohibit accidental second stacks and implicit upgrades.
2. Define inspect/reuse/start/readiness/failure states, separate warm/cold/download budgets, helper lifecycle and honest partial status.
3. Research actual host startup events and record the required integration path for Claude Code, Codex, Pi and Desktop; distinguish documented capabilities, observed installed versions and untested Agentmux hooks.
4. Define the shared caller-scoped instance/persistence/work/hub status fields and assign FAIL-55 through FAIL-62 to actual host and Compose qualification. Record Docker availability gaps and submit L01-L05 for review.

**Deliverables**

1. Record LOCAL-01: automatic Docker Compose startup or verified reuse on supported agent-client launch. Approve instance/profile ownership, Docker context selection, enrollment prerequisites, host startup hooks, status schema and timeout targets.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P00-T07-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Record LOCAL-01: automatic Docker Compose startup or verified reuse on supported agent-client launch. Approve instance/profile ownership, Docker context selection, enrollment prerequisites, host startup hooks, status schema and timeout targets.
2. P00-T07-AC02: Every named capability in the scope has a passing focused check or a recorded, unresolved environment/decision gap. A gap prevents this task being marked done; a smaller successful example cannot stand in for the entire scope.
3. P00-T07-AC03: Affected existing behavior has a baseline/candidate comparison or an approved behavior-change record; no capability, required assertion or stored identity is silently removed.
4. P00-T07-AC04: Evidence identifies the candidate commit, actual environment, command and result for each task criterion; secrets and private agent reasoning are excluded. Known limitations, migration and recovery behavior are documented.

**Verification**

1. Review the traceability matrix and inspect contracts together.
2. Run existing relevant suites on supported environments and reproduce the four reported crash/dispatch defects with isolated fixtures.
3. Record the exact commit, tools, fixtures, and results. Review missing environments as gaps, not passes.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

### P00-GATE: Verify and accept P00

**Status:** done. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P00-T01, P00-T02, P00-T03, P00-T04, P00-T05, P00-T06, P00-T07.

**Implementation plan**

1. Confirm every phase task and prerequisite is complete; inspect the actual deliverables and limitations rather than relying on a done label.
2. Run the phase's full acceptance, failure, preservation and rollback checks on the exact candidate and supported environments. Retain per-criterion evidence using gate-record.template.json.
3. Codex reviews actual deliverables and subagent findings and records the advancement decision. Parallelize bounded subagent work only within this phase. Missing evidence remains blocking; no human approval is required.
4. Commit all phase changes and evidence to feat/agentmux-platform-rearchitecture, push, and verify the remote commit. Record that commit before the next phase starts. MERGE-01 remains separate.

**Deliverables**

1. Approved plan revision and decision log
2. Baseline behavior inventory and defect fixtures
3. Compatibility and capacity profiles
4. Component reuse decisions, baseline/candidate results, gain evidence and approved exceptions for ADD-01

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P00-GATE-AC01: Every accepted user decision and all existing functional groups have a named owner phase and verification scenario.
2. P00-GATE-AC02: Codex reviews the complete plan, decision log, contracts and criterion-level evidence, records its review and advancement decision, and verifies the committed and pushed P00 candidate before P01 starts. Ryan and Nick are not required for delivery approval.
3. P00-GATE-AC03: All P01–P04 blocking choices have recorded alternatives, rationale, and consequences. Later choices have a deadline before their owning phase.
4. P00-GATE-AC04: Baseline checks identify passes, failures, missing environments, and historic-only claims separately.
5. P00-GATE-AC05: The complete source inventory, component reuse decisions and behavior checks are reviewed. Every baseline file and additional governed source file has an owner; unmapped entry points or uncertain behavior are recorded as blocking gaps. No retirement is implied by a launch-scope choice.
6. P00-GATE-AC06: LOCAL-01 has a reviewed host/platform support matrix, stable instance identity, safe Docker context and credential rules, readiness/status contract, and assigned verification owners. Automatic launch is required for every integration advertised as supporting it.
7. P00-GATE-AC07: All assigned failure scenarios and component checks have reviewed evidence for the candidate; missing or skipped required checks remain blocking.
8. P00-GATE-AC08: The required reviewer and advancement decision are recorded, and the phase commit is verified on the current remote feature branch. No merge is performed.

**Verification**

1. Review the traceability matrix and inspect contracts together.
2. Run existing relevant suites on supported environments and reproduce the four reported crash/dispatch defects with isolated fixtures.
3. Record the exact commit, tools, fixtures, and results. Review missing environments as gaps, not passes.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

## P01. Executable contracts, baseline repairs, and verification

Contracts and failure scenarios can be tested before business plugins grow.

**Epic acceptance criteria**

- **P01-AC01:** Two independently implemented test clients exchange valid requests and reject incompatible or malformed envelopes.
- **P01-AC02:** Fixtures cover duplicate, delayed, out-of-order, unauthorized, canceled, timed-out, and replayed messages without conflating execution with delivery.
- **P01-AC03:** A failing predecessor gate prevents promotion. Waivers cannot bypass accepted ownership or security invariants.
- **P01-AC04:** CI captures exact versions and logs without recording credentials or private model reasoning. Known baseline blockers are repaired or disproved with evidence, and the required repository governance gate passes before P02 progression.
- **P01-AC05:** Two language clients pass the NATS storage fixtures on pinned server/client versions: competing revisions admit one transition, partial atomic batches leave no partial record set, and lost acknowledgments reconcile the same operation. Unsupported cross-stream or external-effect transactions are rejected or handled by an explicit recovery contract.
- **P01-AC06:** The existing regression assertions are retained or mapped to equivalent assertions. Characterization fixtures capture each affected behavior before refactoring; a deliberately removed assertion, missing component, or unapproved retirement prevents progression.

2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.

2. Break one contract fixture and one phase gate deliberately and confirm the pipeline refuses promotion.
3. Exercise a real broker restart and reconnect in the harness.
4. Run FAIL-42, FAIL-43 and FAIL-47 with real JetStream. Record which server/API/SDK capabilities provide each guarantee, including batch behavior and authoritative read freshness.
5. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

### P01-T02: Create reusable contract fixtures and controllable fake workers/providers plus real NATS integration environments for CI.

**Status:** in_progress. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P00-GATE, P01-T08.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Create reusable contract fixtures and controllable fake workers/providers plus real NATS integration environments for CI.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.

**Deliverables**

1. Create reusable contract fixtures and controllable fake workers/providers plus real NATS integration environments for CI.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P01-T02-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Create reusable contract fixtures and controllable fake workers/providers plus real NATS integration environments for CI.
2. P01-T02-AC02: Every named capability in the scope has a passing focused check or a recorded, unresolved environment/decision gap. A gap prevents this task being marked done; a smaller successful example cannot stand in for the entire scope.
3. P01-T02-AC03: Affected existing behavior has a baseline/candidate comparison or an approved behavior-change record; no capability, required assertion or stored identity is silently removed.
4. P01-T02-AC04: Evidence identifies the candidate commit, actual environment, command and result for each task criterion; secrets and private agent reasoning are excluded. Known limitations, migration and recovery behavior are documented.

**Verification**

1. Run schema/contract suites in macOS, Linux, and WSL test jobs.
2. Break one contract fixture and one phase gate deliberately and confirm the pipeline refuses promotion.
3. Exercise a real broker restart and reconnect in the harness.
4. Run FAIL-42, FAIL-43 and FAIL-47 with real JetStream. Record which server/API/SDK capabilities provide each guarantee, including batch behavior and authoritative read freshness.
5. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

### P01-T07: Build a bounded NATS persistence spike before production storage code: one owning task record, persistent operation identity, conditional competing writes, complete provenance/effect intent, lost acknowledgments and replay

**Status:** in_progress. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P00-GATE, P01-T08.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Build a bounded NATS persistence spike before production storage code: one owning task record, persistent operation identity, conditional competing writes, complete provenance/effect intent, lost acknowledgments and replay. Exercise single-record commits and any required atomic batch inside one stream.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.
6. Preserve the assertions assigned to this task for AMX-BASE-002 in delivery/evidence/P00/baseline-findings.md. Re-run or port the actual fixtures at the changed authority boundary; preserve explicitly open broader acceptance requirements.

**Deliverables**

1. Build a bounded NATS persistence spike before production storage code: one owning task record, persistent operation identity, conditional competing writes, complete provenance/effect intent, lost acknowledgments and replay. Exercise single-record commits and any required atomic batch inside one stream.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P01-T07-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Build a bounded NATS persistence spike before production storage code: one owning task record, persistent operation identity, conditional competing writes, complete provenance/effect intent, lost acknowledgments and replay.

### P01-T08: Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller

**Status:** done. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P00-GATE.

**Implementation plan**

1. Review the phase-owned components in the preservation matrix and identify every changed caller, command, route, state record, integration and UI action; also include cross-phase callers affected by this work.
2. Record retain/wrap/extract/extend/replace decisions with reasons. Map each old assertion and data identity to its target. Capture missing characterization fixtures before refactoring.
3. Run the available baseline checks and define the candidate, migration/rollback and added-functionality checks. Candidate execution belongs to the implementation and final phase gate, so this preparation does not depend on future code being finished.
4. Maintain the inventory and behavior ownership throughout the phase. Missing environments stay open. Codex reviews any capability change against the complete user-authorized scope; autonomy does not permit silent scope reduction.

**Deliverables**

1. Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller. Record reuse, intentional behavior changes, migration needs and the specific added functionality before editing implementation.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P01-T08-AC01: Every phase-owned component and affected cross-phase caller has a recorded scope, existing behavior and owner; no changed source is unmapped.
2. P01-T08-AC02: Baseline evidence distinguishes passing, failing, unavailable and historical results. Any gap that prevents a safe planned change remains blocking.
3. P01-T08-AC03: Reuse and migration decisions name alternatives, preserved IDs/assertions and rollback boundaries; required approval exists before any capability reduction.
4. P01-T08-AC04: Candidate comparison, added-functionality and migration fixtures are assigned to implementation and phase verification tasks. This preflight does not claim that future candidate tests already passed.

**Verification**

1. Run schema/contract suites in macOS, Linux, and WSL test jobs.
2. Break one contract fixture and one phase gate deliberately and confirm the pipeline refuses promotion.
3. Exercise a real broker restart and reconnect in the harness.
4. Run FAIL-42, FAIL-43 and FAIL-47 with real JetStream. Record which server/API/SDK capabilities provide each guarantee, including batch behavior and authoritative read freshness.
5. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

### P01-GATE: Verify and accept P01

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P01-T01, P01-T02, P01-T03, P01-T04, P01-T05, P01-T06, P01-T07, P01-T08.

**Implementation plan**

1. Confirm every phase task and prerequisite is complete; inspect the actual deliverables and limitations rather than relying on a done label.
2. Run the phase's full acceptance, failure, preservation and rollback checks on the exact candidate and supported environments. Retain per-criterion evidence using gate-record.template.json.
3. Codex reviews actual deliverables and subagent findings and records the advancement decision. Parallelize bounded subagent work only within this phase. Missing evidence remains blocking; no human approval is required.
4. Commit all phase changes and evidence to feat/agentmux-platform-rearchitecture, push, and verify the remote commit. Record that commit before the next phase starts. MERGE-01 remains separate.

**Deliverables**

1. Contract version 1 fixtures
2. Failure injection harness
3. CI gate and compatibility reports
4. NATS storage capability report and transaction-boundary fixtures for STATE-01
5. Component reuse decisions, baseline/candidate results, gain evidence and approved exceptions for ADD-01

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P01-GATE-AC01: Two independently implemented test clients exchange valid requests and reject incompatible or malformed envelopes.
2. P01-GATE-AC02: Fixtures cover duplicate, delayed, out-of-order, unauthorized, canceled, timed-out, and replayed messages without conflating execution with delivery.
3. P01-GATE-AC03: A failing predecessor gate prevents promotion. Waivers cannot bypass accepted ownership or security invariants.
4. P01-GATE-AC04: CI captures exact versions and logs without recording credentials or private model reasoning. Known baseline blockers are repaired or disproved with evidence, and the required repository governance gate passes before P02 progression.
5. P01-GATE-AC05: Two language clients pass the NATS storage fixtures on pinned server/client versions: competing revisions admit one transition, partial atomic batches leave no partial record set, and lost acknowledgments reconcile the same operation. Unsupported cross-stream or external-effect transactions are rejected or handled by an explicit recovery contract.
6. P01-GATE-AC06: The existing regression assertions are retained or mapped to equivalent assertions. Characterization fixtures capture each affected behavior before refactoring; a deliberately removed assertion, missing component, or unapproved retirement prevents progression.
7. P01-GATE-AC07: All assigned failure scenarios and component checks have reviewed evidence for the candidate; missing or skipped required checks remain blocking.
8. P01-GATE-AC08: The required reviewer and advancement decision are recorded, and the phase commit is verified on the current remote feature branch. No merge is performed.

**Verification**

1. Run schema/contract suites in macOS, Linux, and WSL test jobs.
2. Break one contract fixture and one phase gate deliberately and confirm the pipeline refuses promotion.
3. Exercise a real broker restart and reconnect in the harness.
4. Run FAIL-42, FAIL-43 and FAIL-47 with real JetStream. Record which server/API/SDK capabilities provide each guarantee, including batch behavior and authoritative read freshness.
5. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

## P02. Protected boot and the NATS foundation

A local installation boots deterministically with protected kernel plugins.

**Epic acceptance criteria**

- **P02-AC01:** macOS, Linux, and WSL installations boot without an LLM or hosted Jev connection.
- **P02-AC02:** An outside plugin can subscribe only to permitted kernel information and cannot publish commands or writes into the kernel.
- **P02-AC03:** Bad configuration, occupied ports, unavailable broker, and failed protected plugin produce actionable bounded failures.
- **P02-AC04:** Surrounding plugin failure does not corrupt boot state. Ordinary runtime communication uses NATS after bootstrap.
- **P02-AC05:** The existing launcher, environment selection and failure diagnostics remain available while the new boot path is opt-in. Both paths pass their defined startup and shutdown comparisons without sharing ownership of a live task.
- **P02-AC06:** LOCAL-01 cold launch starts the selected local Compose stack and waits for broker persistence and application readiness. Warm launch reuses the same instance without recreation or lost state. macOS, Linux and WSL fixtures pass without an LLM or Jev.
- **P02-AC07:** Simultaneous launches and a crashed startup owner converge on one owned instance. Wrong Docker context, conflicting ports, incompatible versions and partial startup produce bounded, specific diagnostics without deleting volumes, starting a shadow stack or attaching to another user.
- **P02-AC08:** The same versioned status response follows successful start and reuse. It includes instance identity/version, selected profile and endpoint, readiness, persistence health and authorized hub information with freshness. Missing or unimplemented services are labeled unavailable, never healthy.

### P02-T06: Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P01-GATE.

**Implementation plan**

1. Review the phase-owned components in the preservation matrix and identify every changed caller, command, route, state record, integration and UI action; also include cross-phase callers affected by this work.
2. Record retain/wrap/extract/extend/replace decisions with reasons. Map each old assertion and data identity to its target. Capture missing characterization fixtures before refactoring.
3. Run the available baseline checks and define the candidate, migration/rollback and added-functionality checks. Candidate execution belongs to the implementation and final phase gate, so this preparation does not depend on future code being finished.
4. Maintain the inventory and behavior ownership throughout the phase. Missing environments stay open. Codex reviews any capability change against the complete user-authorized scope; autonomy does not permit silent scope reduction.

**Deliverables**

1. Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller. Record reuse, intentional behavior changes, migration needs and the specific added functionality before editing implementation.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P02-T06-AC01: Every phase-owned component and affected cross-phase caller has a recorded scope, existing behavior and owner; no changed source is unmapped.
2. P02-T06-AC02: Baseline evidence distinguishes passing, failing, unavailable and historical results. Any gap that prevents a safe planned change remains blocking.
3. P02-T06-AC03: Reuse and migration decisions name alternatives, preserved IDs/assertions and rollback boundaries; required approval exists before any capability reduction.
4. P02-T06-AC04: Candidate comparison, added-functionality and migration fixtures are assigned to implementation and phase verification tasks. This preflight does not claim that future candidate tests already passed.

**Verification**

1. Capture broker traffic and audit permissions while running normal and unauthorized clients.
2. Cold-start and restart each platform. Kill NATS and one protected plugin at controlled points.
3. Verify late subscribers receive a consistent readiness snapshot and updates.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

### P02-T07: Implement LOCAL-01 bootstrap with pinned Docker Compose configuration, persistent NATS volumes, explicit project identity, bounded health/readiness checks and one startup owner across concurrent terminals

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P01-GATE, P02-T06.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Implement LOCAL-01 bootstrap with pinned Docker Compose configuration, persistent NATS volumes, explicit project identity, bounded health/readiness checks and one startup owner across concurrent terminals. Reuse an authorized compatible healthy instance without recreating it.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.

1. P02-T07-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Implement LOCAL-01 bootstrap with pinned Docker Compose configuration, persistent NATS volumes, explicit project identity, bounded health/readiness checks and one startup owner across concurrent terminals. Reuse an authorized compatible healthy instance without recreating it.
2. P02-T07-AC02: Every named capability in the scope has a passing focused check or a recorded, unresolved environment/decision gap. A gap prevents this task being marked done; a smaller successful example cannot stand in for the entire scope.

### P02-GATE: Verify and accept P02

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P02-T01, P02-T02, P02-T03, P02-T04, P02-T05, P02-T06, P02-T07.

**Implementation plan**

1. Confirm every phase task and prerequisite is complete; inspect the actual deliverables and limitations rather than relying on a done label.
2. Run the phase's full acceptance, failure, preservation and rollback checks on the exact candidate and supported environments. Retain per-criterion evidence using gate-record.template.json.
3. Codex reviews actual deliverables and subagent findings and records the advancement decision. Parallelize bounded subagent work only within this phase. Missing evidence remains blocking; no human approval is required.
4. Commit all phase changes and evidence to feat/agentmux-platform-rearchitecture, push, and verify the remote commit. Record that commit before the next phase starts. MERGE-01 remains separate.

**Deliverables**

1. Boot and shutdown matrix
2. Kernel publication contract and permission tests
3. Bootstrap recovery guide
4. Component reuse decisions, baseline/candidate results, gain evidence and approved exceptions for ADD-01

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P02-GATE-AC01: macOS, Linux, and WSL installations boot without an LLM or hosted Jev connection.
2. P02-GATE-AC02: An outside plugin can subscribe only to permitted kernel information and cannot publish commands or writes into the kernel.
3. P02-GATE-AC03: Bad configuration, occupied ports, unavailable broker, and failed protected plugin produce actionable bounded failures.
4. P02-GATE-AC04: Surrounding plugin failure does not corrupt boot state. Ordinary runtime communication uses NATS after bootstrap.
5. P02-GATE-AC05: The existing launcher, environment selection and failure diagnostics remain available while the new boot path is opt-in. Both paths pass their defined startup and shutdown comparisons without sharing ownership of a live task.
6. P02-GATE-AC06: LOCAL-01 cold launch starts the selected local Compose stack and waits for broker persistence and application readiness. Warm launch reuses the same instance without recreation or lost state. macOS, Linux and WSL fixtures pass without an LLM or Jev.
7. P02-GATE-AC07: Simultaneous launches and a crashed startup owner converge on one owned instance. Wrong Docker context, conflicting ports, incompatible versions and partial startup produce bounded, specific diagnostics without deleting volumes, starting a shadow stack or attaching to another user.
8. P02-GATE-AC08: The same versioned status response follows successful start and reuse. It includes instance identity/version, selected profile and endpoint, readiness, persistence health and authorized hub information with freshness. Missing or unimplemented services are labeled unavailable, never healthy.
9. P02-GATE-AC09: All assigned failure scenarios and component checks have reviewed evidence for the candidate; missing or skipped required checks remain blocking.
10. P02-GATE-AC10: The required reviewer and advancement decision are recorded, and the phase commit is verified on the current remote feature branch. No merge is performed.

**Verification**

1. Capture broker traffic and audit permissions while running normal and unauthorized clients.
2. Cold-start and restart each platform. Kill NATS and one protected plugin at controlled points.
3. Verify late subscribers receive a consistent readiness snapshot and updates.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.
5. Exercise FAIL-55–FAIL-59 with real Compose processes and persistent volumes. In P02 use declared status fixtures for later services; repeat against real client and federation implementations in P06/P10/P12.

## P03. Plugin framework, nested packages, and inherited context

A third-party author can build a compatible trusted plugin without changing the kernel.

**Epic acceptance criteria**

- **P03-AC01:** Both child package modes install and activate correctly. Removing one parent retains independent children used elsewhere.
- **P03-AC02:** Two concurrent users cannot overwrite an ambient current-user/current-project value. A child cannot widen its grant or forge logger identity.
- **P03-AC03:** Dependency cycles, missing versions, partial initialization, and stale handles fail deterministically and clean up resources.
- **P03-AC04:** A plugin in each selected language passes the same contract fixtures and interacts with another plugin over NATS.
- **P03-AC05:** The protected kernel has no replacement option in package management. Trusted native code is accurately documented as unsandboxed.
- **P03-AC06:** Existing federation plugin lifecycle, command registry, contributions and context each have a documented reuse or justified replacement decision. Existing bundled plugins pass compatibility fixtures before their old runtime path is disabled.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P03-T03-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Support independently reusable and parent-owned child packages, separately declaring runtime instance ownership and placement.
2. P03-T03-AC02: Every named capability in the scope has a passing focused check or a recorded, unresolved environment/decision gap. A gap prevents this task being marked done; a smaller successful example cannot stand in for the entire scope.
3. P03-T03-AC03: Affected existing behavior has a baseline/candidate comparison or an approved behavior-change record; no capability, required assertion or stored identity is silently removed.
4. P03-T03-AC04: Evidence identifies the candidate commit, actual environment, command and result for each task criterion; secrets and private agent reasoning are excluded. Known limitations, migration and recovery behavior are documented.

**Verification**

1. Run an independent author exercise using only published SDK/docs.
2. Test lifecycle/resource leaks, dependency failure, configuration precedence, version skew, and upgrades with active operations.
3. Inspect NATS traces and execute negative tests at remote resource owners.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

### P03-T04: Inject PluginContext and per-call OperationContext

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P02-GATE, P03-T07.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Inject PluginContext and per-call OperationContext. Supply identity, scoped logger, tracing/metrics, config, lifecycle, clock, and approved NATS service clients.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.

### P03-T06: Build starter SDKs and conformance tooling in at least two selected languages

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P02-GATE, P03-T07.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Build starter SDKs and conformance tooling in at least two selected languages. Provide install/upgrade/disable/uninstall and drain behavior.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.

### P03-T07: Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P02-GATE.

**Implementation plan**

1. Review the phase-owned components in the preservation matrix and identify every changed caller, command, route, state record, integration and UI action; also include cross-phase callers affected by this work.
2. Record retain/wrap/extract/extend/replace decisions with reasons. Map each old assertion and data identity to its target. Capture missing characterization fixtures before refactoring.
3. Run the available baseline checks and define the candidate, migration/rollback and added-functionality checks. Candidate execution belongs to the implementation and final phase gate, so this preparation does not depend on future code being finished.
4. Maintain the inventory and behavior ownership throughout the phase. Missing environments stay open. Codex reviews any capability change against the complete user-authorized scope; autonomy does not permit silent scope reduction.

**Deliverables**

1. Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller. Record reuse, intentional behavior changes, migration needs and the specific added functionality before editing implementation.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P03-T07-AC01: Every phase-owned component and affected cross-phase caller has a recorded scope, existing behavior and owner; no changed source is unmapped.
2. P03-T07-AC02: Baseline evidence distinguishes passing, failing, unavailable and historical results. Any gap that prevents a safe planned change remains blocking.
3. P03-T07-AC03: Reuse and migration decisions name alternatives, preserved IDs/assertions and rollback boundaries; required approval exists before any capability reduction.
4. P03-T07-AC04: Candidate comparison, added-functionality and migration fixtures are assigned to implementation and phase verification tasks. This preflight does not claim that future candidate tests already passed.

**Verification**

1. Run an independent author exercise using only published SDK/docs.
2. Test lifecycle/resource leaks, dependency failure, configuration precedence, version skew, and upgrades with active operations.
3. Inspect NATS traces and execute negative tests at remote resource owners.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

### P03-GATE: Verify and accept P03

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P03-T01, P03-T02, P03-T03, P03-T04, P03-T05, P03-T06, P03-T07.

**Implementation plan**

1. Confirm every phase task and prerequisite is complete; inspect the actual deliverables and limitations rather than relying on a done label.
2. Run the phase's full acceptance, failure, preservation and rollback checks on the exact candidate and supported environments. Retain per-criterion evidence using gate-record.template.json.
3. Codex reviews actual deliverables and subagent findings and records the advancement decision. Parallelize bounded subagent work only within this phase. Missing evidence remains blocking; no human approval is required.
4. Commit all phase changes and evidence to feat/agentmux-platform-rearchitecture, push, and verify the remote commit. Record that commit before the next phase starts. MERGE-01 remains separate.

**Deliverables**

1. Plugin manifest and SDK reference
2. Conformance matrix and author tutorial
3. Nested-package/lifecycle test report
4. Component reuse decisions, baseline/candidate results, gain evidence and approved exceptions for ADD-01

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P03-GATE-AC01: Both child package modes install and activate correctly. Removing one parent retains independent children used elsewhere.
2. P03-GATE-AC02: Two concurrent users cannot overwrite an ambient current-user/current-project value. A child cannot widen its grant or forge logger identity.
3. P03-GATE-AC03: Dependency cycles, missing versions, partial initialization, and stale handles fail deterministically and clean up resources.
4. P03-GATE-AC04: A plugin in each selected language passes the same contract fixtures and interacts with another plugin over NATS.
5. P03-GATE-AC05: The protected kernel has no replacement option in package management. Trusted native code is accurately documented as unsandboxed.
6. P03-GATE-AC06: Existing federation plugin lifecycle, command registry, contributions and context each have a documented reuse or justified replacement decision. Existing bundled plugins pass compatibility fixtures before their old runtime path is disabled.
7. P03-GATE-AC07: All assigned failure scenarios and component checks have reviewed evidence for the candidate; missing or skipped required checks remain blocking.
8. P03-GATE-AC08: The required reviewer and advancement decision are recorded, and the phase commit is verified on the current remote feature branch. No merge is performed.

**Verification**

1. Run an independent author exercise using only published SDK/docs.
2. Test lifecycle/resource leaks, dependency failure, configuration precedence, version skew, and upgrades with active operations.
3. Inspect NATS traces and execute negative tests at remote resource owners.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

## P04. Identity, projects, durable state, and workspaces

Multiple users and projects share a hub with explicit authority and durable ownership.

**Epic acceptance criteria**

- **P04-AC01:** Cross-user/project/organization negative tests deny unauthorized commands, subscriptions, files, artifacts, and secret resolution.
- **P04-AC02:** A committed NATS record or qualified same-stream batch preserves the state change, provenance and recoverable outgoing intent. Crashes before or after commit, publication or acknowledgment converge to the recorded operation without a second business effect.
- **P04-AC03:** Duplicate delivery with the same operation ID and payload hash returns the existing outcome without allocating a second workspace or task. Reusing an operation ID with a different payload is rejected as a conflict.
- **P04-AC04:** Backup/restore preserves ownership and result provenance. Migration fences the former writer, preserves stable IDs, dirty worktrees and unmerged branches, and verifies imported records before admitting new writes.
- **P04-AC05:** Node revocation and secret rotation have tested online behavior and explicit offline limits.
- **P04-AC06:** Deleting or corrupting an optional SQL index or derived KV view is recoverable from retained authoritative records and validated checkpoints. Rebuild preserves authorized results and cursors, detects missing history, and cannot launch work or replay external effects.
- **P04-AC07:** Task history and reservations survive work-queue acknowledgment and presence expiry. Storage/API permissions prevent unauthorized reads and raw writes. Stale views expose their revision and cannot authorize a claim, approval or reassignment.
- **P04-AC08:** Every affected existing component retains its documented behavior through reused code or a justified replacement. Its baseline and candidate checks, migration checks, and added capability evidence are reviewed before advancement. Missing environments remain open. Codex reviews intended behavior and migration changes against the full user scope; autonomous delivery does not authorize capability removal, reduced scope or weaker verification.

P04-T05-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Implement the approved worker execution profile so mutually untrusted task code cannot share unrestricted access to another user's files or credentials. Qualify OS/container/host separation independently of the later third-party-plugin sandbox.
2. P04-T05-AC02: Every named capability in the scope has a passing focused check or a recorded, unresolved environment/decision gap. A gap prevents this task being marked done; a smaller successful example cannot stand in for the entire scope.
3. P04-T05-AC03: Affected existing behavior has a baseline/candidate comparison or an approved behavior-change record; no capability, required assertion or stored identity is silently removed.
4. P04-T05-AC04: Evidence identifies the candidate commit, actual environment, command and result for each task criterion; secrets and private agent reasoning are excluded. Known limitations, migration and recovery behavior are documented.

**Verification**

1. Run the permission matrix against application owners and real broker accounts. Run an adversarial worker that attempts cross-project file, process, network, and credential access under the supported execution profile.
2. Inject failures before/after commit and publish acknowledgment, exhaust disk/quota, and restore from backup.
3. Run concurrency tests against every supported storage provider. Reject a provider that lacks required guarantees.
4. Run FAIL-42 through FAIL-48, delete projections, corrupt a checkpoint, simulate lagging views and test direct broker APIs. Verify snapshots and retained history form a complete recovery chain.
5. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

### P04-T06: Build optional SQLite/SQL query indexes and caches from committed records and versioned checkpoints

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P03-GATE, P04-T07.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Build optional SQLite/SQL query indexes and caches from committed records and versioned checkpoints. Record consumed sequence and schema version, expose freshness, rebuild without commands or side effects, and prevent projections from granting execution or approval.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.
6. Preserve the assertions assigned to this task for AMX-BASE-006 in delivery/evidence/P00/baseline-findings.md. Re-run or port the actual fixtures at the changed authority boundary; preserve explicitly open broader acceptance requirements.

**Deliverables**

1. Build optional SQLite/SQL query indexes and caches from committed records and versioned checkpoints. Record consumed sequence and schema version, expose freshness, rebuild without commands or side effects, and prevent projections from granting execution or approval.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P04-T06-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Build optional SQLite/SQL query indexes and caches from committed records and versioned checkpoints.

### P04-T07: Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P03-GATE.

**Implementation plan**

1. Review the phase-owned components in the preservation matrix and identify every changed caller, command, route, state record, integration and UI action; also include cross-phase callers affected by this work.
2. Record retain/wrap/extract/extend/replace decisions with reasons. Map each old assertion and data identity to its target. Capture missing characterization fixtures before refactoring.
3. Run the available baseline checks and define the candidate, migration/rollback and added-functionality checks. Candidate execution belongs to the implementation and final phase gate, so this preparation does not depend on future code being finished.
4. Maintain the inventory and behavior ownership throughout the phase. Missing environments stay open. Codex reviews any capability change against the complete user-authorized scope; autonomy does not permit silent scope reduction.

**Deliverables**

1. Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller. Record reuse, intentional behavior changes, migration needs and the specific added functionality before editing implementation.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P04-T07-AC01: Every phase-owned component and affected cross-phase caller has a recorded scope, existing behavior and owner; no changed source is unmapped.
2. P04-T07-AC02: Baseline evidence distinguishes passing, failing, unavailable and historical results. Any gap that prevents a safe planned change remains blocking.
3. P04-T07-AC03: Reuse and migration decisions name alternatives, preserved IDs/assertions and rollback boundaries; required approval exists before any capability reduction.
4. P04-T07-AC04: Candidate comparison, added-functionality and migration fixtures are assigned to implementation and phase verification tasks. This preflight does not claim that future candidate tests already passed.

**Verification**

1. Run the permission matrix against application owners and real broker accounts. Run an adversarial worker that attempts cross-project file, process, network, and credential access under the supported execution profile.
2. Inject failures before/after commit and publish acknowledgment, exhaust disk/quota, and restore from backup.
3. Run concurrency tests against every supported storage provider. Reject a provider that lacks required guarantees.
4. Run FAIL-42 through FAIL-48, delete projections, corrupt a checkpoint, simulate lagging views and test direct broker APIs. Verify snapshots and retained history form a complete recovery chain.
5. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

### P04-GATE: Verify and accept P04

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P04-T01, P04-T02, P04-T03, P04-T04, P04-T05, P04-T06, P04-T07.

**Implementation plan**

1. Confirm every phase task and prerequisite is complete; inspect the actual deliverables and limitations rather than relying on a done label.
2. Run the phase's full acceptance, failure, preservation and rollback checks on the exact candidate and supported environments. Retain per-criterion evidence using gate-record.template.json.
3. Codex reviews actual deliverables and subagent findings and records the advancement decision. Parallelize bounded subagent work only within this phase. Missing evidence remains blocking; no human approval is required.
4. Commit all phase changes and evidence to feat/agentmux-platform-rearchitecture, push, and verify the remote commit. Record that commit before the next phase starts. MERGE-01 remains separate.

**Deliverables**

1. Threat model and permission matrix
2. Storage capability and migration contracts
3. Recovery and isolation reports
4. Authoritative record, KV and object inventory with retention, checkpoint and projection rebuild evidence
5. Component reuse decisions, baseline/candidate results, gain evidence and approved exceptions for ADD-01

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P04-GATE-AC01: Cross-user/project/organization negative tests deny unauthorized commands, subscriptions, files, artifacts, and secret resolution.
2. P04-GATE-AC02: A committed NATS record or qualified same-stream batch preserves the state change, provenance and recoverable outgoing intent. Crashes before or after commit, publication or acknowledgment converge to the recorded operation without a second business effect.
3. P04-GATE-AC03: Duplicate delivery with the same operation ID and payload hash returns the existing outcome without allocating a second workspace or task. Reusing an operation ID with a different payload is rejected as a conflict.
4. P04-GATE-AC04: Backup/restore preserves ownership and result provenance. Migration fences the former writer, preserves stable IDs, dirty worktrees and unmerged branches, and verifies imported records before admitting new writes.
5. P04-GATE-AC05: Node revocation and secret rotation have tested online behavior and explicit offline limits.
6. P04-GATE-AC06: Deleting or corrupting an optional SQL index or derived KV view is recoverable from retained authoritative records and validated checkpoints. Rebuild preserves authorized results and cursors, detects missing history, and cannot launch work or replay external effects.
7. P04-GATE-AC07: Task history and reservations survive work-queue acknowledgment and presence expiry. Storage/API permissions prevent unauthorized reads and raw writes. Stale views expose their revision and cannot authorize a claim, approval or reassignment.
8. P04-GATE-AC08: Every affected existing component retains its documented behavior through reused code or a justified replacement. Its baseline and candidate checks, migration checks, and added capability evidence are reviewed before advancement. Missing environments remain open. Codex reviews intended behavior and migration changes against the full user scope; autonomous delivery does not authorize capability removal, reduced scope or weaker verification.
9. P04-GATE-AC09: All assigned failure scenarios and component checks have reviewed evidence for the candidate; missing or skipped required checks remain blocking.
10. P04-GATE-AC10: The required reviewer and advancement decision are recorded, and the phase commit is verified on the current remote feature branch. No merge is performed.

**Verification**

1. Run the permission matrix against application owners and real broker accounts. Run an adversarial worker that attempts cross-project file, process, network, and credential access under the supported execution profile.
2. Inject failures before/after commit and publish acknowledgment, exhaust disk/quota, and restore from backup.
3. Run concurrency tests against every supported storage provider. Reject a provider that lacks required guarantees.
4. Run FAIL-42 through FAIL-48, delete projections, corrupt a checkpoint, simulate lagging views and test direct broker APIs. Verify snapshots and retained history form a complete recovery chain.
5. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

## P05. Local orchestration and evidence-based completion

A developer can finish a reviewable software task through durable coordinated work.

**Epic acceptance criteria**

- **P05-AC01:** A complete fixture workflow creates a plan, delegates tasks, executes in isolated workspaces, validates the result, and returns reviewable evidence.
- **P05-AC02:** Two developers working on different or shared projects do not steal each other's claims, sessions, workspaces, or tool credentials.
- **P05-AC03:** No task becomes accepted from terminal text, process exit, or a worker's self-reported done event alone.
- **P05-AC04:** A crashed or disconnected worker leaves a recoverable known or explicitly unknown attempt. Retry preserves the prior attempt and its effects.
- **P05-AC05:** Every P05-owned legacy functional group has parity evidence or an explicit replacement and data migration decision. Later client, dashboard, federation, and domain groups have an owned inventory and migration plan, with parity gated in their own phases. Changed artifacts invalidate bound approvals, and migration preserves distinct board, run, hub-work, and shared-board identities.
- **P05-AC06:** Every affected existing component retains its documented behavior through reused code or a justified replacement. Its baseline and candidate checks, migration checks, and added capability evidence are reviewed before advancement. Missing environments remain open. Codex reviews intended behavior and migration changes against the full user scope; autonomous delivery does not authorize capability removal, reduced scope or weaker verification.

4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.

**Deliverables**

1. Preserve epics, sprints, ADR/capability proposal records, WIP/readiness gates, notifications, objections, and independent reviewer policy. Bind reviews to immutable repository/commit/artifact identities across multiple repositories.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P05-T07-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Preserve epics, sprints, ADR/capability proposal records, WIP/readiness gates, notifications, objections, and independent reviewer policy. Bind reviews to immutable repository/commit/artifact identities across multiple repositories.
2. P05-T07-AC02: Every named capability in the scope has a passing focused check or a recorded, unresolved environment/decision gap. A gap prevents this task being marked done; a smaller successful example cannot stand in for the entire scope.
3. P05-T07-AC03: Affected existing behavior has a baseline/candidate comparison or an approved behavior-change record; no capability, required assertion or stored identity is silently removed.
4. P05-T07-AC04: Evidence identifies the candidate commit, actual environment, command and result for each task criterion; secrets and private agent reasoning are excluded. Known limitations, migration and recovery behavior are documented.

**Verification**

1. Run normal, failure, retry, cancellation, resume, parallel-team, cross-repo, and swarm-style scenario suites.
2. Inject crash windows around work attribution and result publication identified in the repository analysis.
3. Use real CLI worker smoke tests plus deterministic fake workers for exhaustive state transitions.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

### P05-T08: Persist orchestration transitions through the NATS-owning domain contracts

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P04-GATE, P05-T09.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Persist orchestration transitions through the NATS-owning domain contracts. Drive dispatch and result publication from recoverable committed intent, and keep queue acknowledgment separate from task completion and origin acceptance.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.
6. Preserve the assertions assigned to this task for AMX-BASE-002, AMX-BASE-003 in delivery/evidence/P00/baseline-findings.md. Re-run or port the actual fixtures at the changed authority boundary; preserve explicitly open broader acceptance requirements.

**Deliverables**

1. Persist orchestration transitions through the NATS-owning domain contracts. Drive dispatch and result publication from recoverable committed intent, and keep queue acknowledgment separate from task completion and origin acceptance.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P05-T08-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Persist orchestration transitions through the NATS-owning domain contracts.

3. P05-T08-AC03: Affected existing behavior has a baseline/candidate comparison or an approved behavior-change record; no capability, required assertion or stored identity is silently removed.
4. P05-T08-AC04: Evidence identifies the candidate commit, actual environment, command and result for each task criterion; secrets and private agent reasoning are excluded. Known limitations, migration and recovery behavior are documented.

**Verification**

### P05-T09: Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P04-GATE.

**Implementation plan**

1. Review the phase-owned components in the preservation matrix and identify every changed caller, command, route, state record, integration and UI action; also include cross-phase callers affected by this work.
2. Record retain/wrap/extract/extend/replace decisions with reasons. Map each old assertion and data identity to its target. Capture missing characterization fixtures before refactoring.
3. Run the available baseline checks and define the candidate, migration/rollback and added-functionality checks. Candidate execution belongs to the implementation and final phase gate, so this preparation does not depend on future code being finished.
4. Maintain the inventory and behavior ownership throughout the phase. Missing environments stay open. Codex reviews any capability change against the complete user-authorized scope; autonomy does not permit silent scope reduction.

**Deliverables**

1. Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller. Record reuse, intentional behavior changes, migration needs and the specific added functionality before editing implementation.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P05-T09-AC01: Every phase-owned component and affected cross-phase caller has a recorded scope, existing behavior and owner; no changed source is unmapped.
2. P05-T09-AC02: Baseline evidence distinguishes passing, failing, unavailable and historical results. Any gap that prevents a safe planned change remains blocking.
3. P05-T09-AC03: Reuse and migration decisions name alternatives, preserved IDs/assertions and rollback boundaries; required approval exists before any capability reduction.
4. P05-T09-AC04: Candidate comparison, added-functionality and migration fixtures are assigned to implementation and phase verification tasks. This preflight does not claim that future candidate tests already passed.

**Verification**

1. Run normal, failure, retry, cancellation, resume, parallel-team, cross-repo, and swarm-style scenario suites.
2. Inject crash windows around work attribution and result publication identified in the repository analysis.
3. Use real CLI worker smoke tests plus deterministic fake workers for exhaustive state transitions.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

### P05-GATE: Verify and accept P05

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P05-T01, P05-T02, P05-T03, P05-T04, P05-T05, P05-T06, P05-T07, P05-T08, P05-T09.

**Implementation plan**

1. Confirm every phase task and prerequisite is complete; inspect the actual deliverables and limitations rather than relying on a done label.
2. Run the phase's full acceptance, failure, preservation and rollback checks on the exact candidate and supported environments. Retain per-criterion evidence using gate-record.template.json.
3. Codex reviews actual deliverables and subagent findings and records the advancement decision. Parallelize bounded subagent work only within this phase. Missing evidence remains blocking; no human approval is required.
4. Commit all phase changes and evidence to feat/agentmux-platform-rearchitecture, push, and verify the remote commit. Record that commit before the next phase starts. MERGE-01 remains separate.

**Deliverables**

1. End-to-end workflow recording
2. Completion/ownership invariant report
3. Legacy parity and migration checklist
4. Component reuse decisions, baseline/candidate results, gain evidence and approved exceptions for ADD-01

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P05-GATE-AC01: A complete fixture workflow creates a plan, delegates tasks, executes in isolated workspaces, validates the result, and returns reviewable evidence.
2. P05-GATE-AC02: Two developers working on different or shared projects do not steal each other's claims, sessions, workspaces, or tool credentials.
3. P05-GATE-AC03: No task becomes accepted from terminal text, process exit, or a worker's self-reported done event alone.
4. P05-GATE-AC04: A crashed or disconnected worker leaves a recoverable known or explicitly unknown attempt. Retry preserves the prior attempt and its effects.
5. P05-GATE-AC05: Every P05-owned legacy functional group has parity evidence or an explicit replacement and data migration decision. Later client, dashboard, federation, and domain groups have an owned inventory and migration plan, with parity gated in their own phases. Changed artifacts invalidate bound approvals, and migration preserves distinct board, run, hub-work, and shared-board identities.
6. P05-GATE-AC06: Every affected existing component retains its documented behavior through reused code or a justified replacement. Its baseline and candidate checks, migration checks, and added capability evidence are reviewed before advancement. Missing environments remain open. Codex reviews intended behavior and migration changes against the full user scope; autonomous delivery does not authorize capability removal, reduced scope or weaker verification.
7. P05-GATE-AC07: All assigned failure scenarios and component checks have reviewed evidence for the candidate; missing or skipped required checks remain blocking.
8. P05-GATE-AC08: The required reviewer and advancement decision are recorded, and the phase commit is verified on the current remote feature branch. No merge is performed.

**Verification**

1. Run normal, failure, retry, cancellation, resume, parallel-team, cross-repo, and swarm-style scenario suites.
2. Inject crash windows around work attribution and result publication identified in the repository analysis.
3. Use real CLI worker smoke tests plus deterministic fake workers for exhaustive state transitions.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

## P06. Agent-client entry points and portable tooling

Developers use Agentmux from their preferred supported client.

**Epic acceptance criteria**

- **P06-AC01:** Each supported client can submit a task, inspect progress/evidence, participate in required approvals, and retrieve the result.
- **P06-AC02:** Unsupported event capture, cancellation, or compaction reports an explicit capability limit instead of simulating success.
- **P06-AC03:** Closing the originating client or observer does not duplicate or implicitly terminate durable work.
- **P06-AC04:** Fresh-user install and uninstall preserve unrelated client settings and secrets.
- **P06-AC05:** All existing supported harness commands, session safeguards, agent definitions, provider setup methods and integration workflows have passing comparisons or an explicitly approved capability change. Retained and added tests cover modal decisions, idle cleanup, credential refresh, WSL paths and external-write uncertainty.
- **P06-AC06:** Installing and configuring the Agentmux plugin makes each supported terminal/client launch automatically start or reuse the selected stack and show its instance and authorized hub summary. Actual-host tests qualify startup hooks or a clearly named installed launcher; manual commands cannot stand in for promised automatic launch.
- **P06-AC07:** Client startup preserves MCP/JSON-RPC framing, never prints secrets and avoids recursive starts by managed workers. Closing a terminal leaves shared work running; an explicit authorized stop follows the drain policy. Failed prerequisites report recovery steps without silently installing privileged software or changing client settings.

### P06-T01: Extend current CLI, MCP, provider and workspace tooling

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P05-GATE, P06-T07.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Extend current CLI, MCP, provider and workspace tooling. Preserve command semantics, safe prompt handling, session cleanup boundaries and credential setup; expose new scopes through the existing entry points where compatible.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.
6. Qualify REPO-01-C01 in actual supported agent hosts: confirm shared instructions and the branch/merge restriction are delivered, preserve user settings, and retain per-host/version evidence. P00 static review is not a substitute.

**Deliverables**

1. Extend current CLI, MCP, provider and workspace tooling. Preserve command semantics, safe prompt handling, session cleanup boundaries and credential setup; expose new scopes through the existing entry points where compatible.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

4. P06-T01-AC04: Evidence identifies the candidate commit, actual environment, command and result for each task criterion; secrets and private agent reasoning are excluded. Known limitations, migration and recovery behavior are documented.

**Verification**

1. Execute the same reference workflow on every pinned client version in the support matrix.
2. Test reconnect, authentication expiry, missing tool, malformed MCP request, and client shutdown.
3. Review provider commercial integration terms before promising a supported paid distribution.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.
5. Run cold, warm and concurrent launches on each advertised client/OS version, including separate WSL sessions and paths with spaces. Capture client-visible status and protocol streams; exercise FAIL-60–FAIL-61.

1. Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller. Record reuse, intentional behavior changes, migration needs and the specific added functionality before editing implementation.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P06-T07-AC01: Every phase-owned component and affected cross-phase caller has a recorded scope, existing behavior and owner; no changed source is unmapped.
2. P06-T07-AC02: Baseline evidence distinguishes passing, failing, unavailable and historical results. Any gap that prevents a safe planned change remains blocking.
3. P06-T07-AC03: Reuse and migration decisions name alternatives, preserved IDs/assertions and rollback boundaries; required approval exists before any capability reduction.
4. P06-T07-AC04: Candidate comparison, added-functionality and migration fixtures are assigned to implementation and phase verification tasks. This preflight does not claim that future candidate tests already passed.

**Verification**

1. Execute the same reference workflow on every pinned client version in the support matrix.
2. Test reconnect, authentication expiry, missing tool, malformed MCP request, and client shutdown.
3. Review provider commercial integration terms before promising a supported paid distribution.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.
5. Run cold, warm and concurrent launches on each advertised client/OS version, including separate WSL sessions and paths with spaces. Capture client-visible status and protocol streams; exercise FAIL-60–FAIL-61.

### P06-T08: Wire LOCAL-01 ensure-running into each supported terminal/client startup integration

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P05-GATE, P06-T07.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Wire LOCAL-01 ensure-running into each supported terminal/client startup integration. Show one concise status summary with dashboard access; provide structured status for clients, suppress recursive bootstrap in managed workers, and keep protocol stdout free of banners.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.

**Deliverables**

1. Wire LOCAL-01 ensure-running into each supported terminal/client startup integration. Show one concise status summary with dashboard access; provide structured status for clients, suppress recursive bootstrap in managed workers, and keep protocol stdout free of banners.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P06-T08-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Wire LOCAL-01 ensure-running into each supported terminal/client startup integration. Show one concise status summary with dashboard access; provide structured status for clients, suppress recursive bootstrap in managed workers, and keep protocol stdout free of banners.
2. P06-T08-AC02: Every named capability in the scope has a passing focused check or a recorded, unresolved environment/decision gap. A gap prevents this task being marked done; a smaller successful example cannot stand in for the entire scope.
3. P06-T08-AC03: Affected existing behavior has a baseline/candidate comparison or an approved behavior-change record; no capability, required assertion or stored identity is silently removed.
4. P06-T08-AC04: Evidence identifies the candidate commit, actual environment, command and result for each task criterion; secrets and private agent reasoning are excluded. Known limitations, migration and recovery behavior are documented.

**Verification**

1. Execute the same reference workflow on every pinned client version in the support matrix.
2. Test reconnect, authentication expiry, missing tool, malformed MCP request, and client shutdown.
3. Review provider commercial integration terms before promising a supported paid distribution.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

### P06-VIDEO-E1: Declarative agent-lifecycle hook contributions

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P05-GATE, P06-T07.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the original proposal, related records, controls and evaluation gates preserved in sourceRecord. Identify shared implementations first; this record does not require a separate service, model call or additive savings claim.
2. Implement or extend a versioned definition/capability for: Declarative agent-lifecycle hook contributions
3. Preserve the item's exact source boundary, permissions and required facts. Use deterministic checks before optional inference, scoped evidence/cache identities, explicit abstention and bounded time/cost. Keep the feature disabled or advisory until qualified.
4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P06-VIDEO-E1-AC01: Unsupported hooks neither load nor pretend to execute; callable tools still work where supported.
2. P06-VIDEO-E1-AC02: Outage/failure of a semantic check never bypasses deterministic denial or silently changes host security policy.
3. P06-VIDEO-E1-AC03: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
4. P06-VIDEO-E1-AC04: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

**Verification**

1. Run the item's required evaluation gates: EVAL-CONTRACT, EVAL-HOST

**Original proposal and item-specific boundaries**

```json
{
  "id": "VIDEO-E1",
  "title": "Declarative agent-lifecycle hook contributions",
  "description": "A plugin can contribute reviewed checks to supported pre-tool, post-tool, end-of-turn and pre-compaction hooks. The runtime records exact capability coverage per client. Deterministic denials execute independently; a model outage produces the configured review/fallback outcome. For clients without hooks, expose only the supported tools and observations."

### P06-GATE: Verify and accept P06

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P06-T01, P06-T02, P06-T03, P06-T04, P06-T05, P06-T06, P06-T07, P06-T08, P06-VIDEO-E1.

**Implementation plan**

1. Confirm every phase task and prerequisite is complete; inspect the actual deliverables and limitations rather than relying on a done label.
2. Run the phase's full acceptance, failure, preservation and rollback checks on the exact candidate and supported environments. Retain per-criterion evidence using gate-record.template.json.
3. Codex reviews actual deliverables and subagent findings and records the advancement decision. Parallelize bounded subagent work only within this phase. Missing evidence remains blocking; no human approval is required.
4. Commit all phase changes and evidence to feat/agentmux-platform-rearchitecture, push, and verify the remote commit. Record that commit before the next phase starts. MERGE-01 remains separate.

**Deliverables**

1. Actual-host compatibility matrix
2. CLI/MCP reference and setup guides
3. Per-client workflow results
4. Component reuse decisions, baseline/candidate results, gain evidence and approved exceptions for ADD-01

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P06-GATE-AC01: Each supported client can submit a task, inspect progress/evidence, participate in required approvals, and retrieve the result.
2. P06-GATE-AC02: Unsupported event capture, cancellation, or compaction reports an explicit capability limit instead of simulating success.
3. P06-GATE-AC03: Closing the originating client or observer does not duplicate or implicitly terminate durable work.
4. P06-GATE-AC04: Fresh-user install and uninstall preserve unrelated client settings and secrets.
5. P06-GATE-AC05: All existing supported harness commands, session safeguards, agent definitions, provider setup methods and integration workflows have passing comparisons or an explicitly approved capability change. Retained and added tests cover modal decisions, idle cleanup, credential refresh, WSL paths and external-write uncertainty.
6. P06-GATE-AC06: Installing and configuring the Agentmux plugin makes each supported terminal/client launch automatically start or reuse the selected stack and show its instance and authorized hub summary. Actual-host tests qualify startup hooks or a clearly named installed launcher; manual commands cannot stand in for promised automatic launch.
7. P06-GATE-AC07: Client startup preserves MCP/JSON-RPC framing, never prints secrets and avoids recursive starts by managed workers. Closing a terminal leaves shared work running; an explicit authorized stop follows the drain policy. Failed prerequisites report recovery steps without silently installing privileged software or changing client settings.
8. P06-GATE-AC08: All assigned failure scenarios and component checks have reviewed evidence for the candidate; missing or skipped required checks remain blocking.
9. P06-GATE-AC09: The required reviewer and advancement decision are recorded, and the phase commit is verified on the current remote feature branch. No merge is performed.

**Verification**

1. Execute the same reference workflow on every pinned client version in the support matrix.
2. Test reconnect, authentication expiry, missing tool, malformed MCP request, and client shutdown.
3. Review provider commercial integration terms before promising a supported paid distribution.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.
5. Run cold, warm and concurrent launches on each advertised client/OS version, including separate WSL sessions and paths with spaces. Capture client-visible status and protocol streams; exercise FAIL-60–FAIL-61.

## P07. Existing dashboard: AG-UI and Atomic Design migration

Authorized users can understand work across agents, projects, and hubs.

**Epic acceptance criteria**

- **P07-AC01:** Refresh, reconnect, duplicate events, delayed events, and history gaps converge to the same authorized view without starting work.
- **P07-AC02:** An unauthorized user cannot access another project's snapshots, streams, conversation, or artifact by guessing an ID.
- **P07-AC03:** Every displayed completion or cancellation state distinguishes worker output from accepted/confirmed state.
- **P07-AC04:** Domain UI contributions use versioned registered components. Core views remain usable when an optional plugin fails.
- **P07-AC05:** Reusable component boundaries and accessibility checks pass for all launch views.
- **P07-AC06:** All ten existing dashboard views and their actions, terminal streams, saved preferences, editor conflicts, themes and integration panels have reviewed before/after evidence. Existing capabilities remain reachable until their replacements pass; AG-UI and component restructuring do not authorize dropping controls.
- **P07-AC07:** Terminal and dashboard status agree at the same source revision. Refresh and reconnect preserve explicit stale/unknown states, hide inaccessible hubs and do not start a second stack or grant additional control.

### P07-T06: Read authorized NATS-backed views with source revisions/checkpoint cursors

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P06-GATE, P07-T07.

### P07-T07: Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P06-GATE.

**Implementation plan**

1. Review the phase-owned components in the preservation matrix and identify every changed caller, command, route, state record, integration and UI action; also include cross-phase callers affected by this work.
2. Record retain/wrap/extract/extend/replace decisions with reasons. Map each old assertion and data identity to its target. Capture missing characterization fixtures before refactoring.
3. Run the available baseline checks and define the candidate, migration/rollback and added-functionality checks. Candidate execution belongs to the implementation and final phase gate, so this preparation does not depend on future code being finished.
4. Maintain the inventory and behavior ownership throughout the phase. Missing environments stay open. Codex reviews any capability change against the complete user-authorized scope; autonomy does not permit silent scope reduction.

**Deliverables**

1. Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller. Record reuse, intentional behavior changes, migration needs and the specific added functionality before editing implementation.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P07-T07-AC01: Every phase-owned component and affected cross-phase caller has a recorded scope, existing behavior and owner; no changed source is unmapped.
2. P07-T07-AC02: Baseline evidence distinguishes passing, failing, unavailable and historical results. Any gap that prevents a safe planned change remains blocking.
3. P07-T07-AC03: Reuse and migration decisions name alternatives, preserved IDs/assertions and rollback boundaries; required approval exists before any capability reduction.
4. P07-T07-AC04: Candidate comparison, added-functionality and migration fixtures are assigned to implementation and phase verification tasks. This preflight does not claim that future candidate tests already passed.

**Verification**

1. Run multi-viewer browser tests, revoked-session tests, stream replay, and network interruptions.
2. Compare UI snapshots to authoritative records after each failure scenario.
3. Run component dependency checks, keyboard/screen-reader review, and visual regression tests.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.
5. Compare terminal and dashboard status snapshots, versions and timestamps, including absent federation support, no configured hubs, denied scope and stale observations.

### P07-T08: Display the LOCAL-01 instance, readiness and authorized hub status in the existing dashboard through its NATS-to-AG-UI interface, using the same versioned status contract as terminal clients.

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P06-GATE, P07-T07.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Display the LOCAL-01 instance, readiness and authorized hub status in the existing dashboard through its NATS-to-AG-UI interface, using the same versioned status contract as terminal clients.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.

**Deliverables**

1. Display the LOCAL-01 instance, readiness and authorized hub status in the existing dashboard through its NATS-to-AG-UI interface, using the same versioned status contract as terminal clients.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P07-T08-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Display the LOCAL-01 instance, readiness and authorized hub status in the existing dashboard through its NATS-to-AG-UI interface, using the same versioned status contract as terminal clients.
2. P07-T08-AC02: Every named capability in the scope has a passing focused check or a recorded, unresolved environment/decision gap. A gap prevents this task being marked done; a smaller successful example cannot stand in for the entire scope.
3. P07-T08-AC03: Affected existing behavior has a baseline/candidate comparison or an approved behavior-change record; no capability, required assertion or stored identity is silently removed.
4. P07-T08-AC04: Evidence identifies the candidate commit, actual environment, command and result for each task criterion; secrets and private agent reasoning are excluded. Known limitations, migration and recovery behavior are documented.

**Verification**

1. Run multi-viewer browser tests, revoked-session tests, stream replay, and network interruptions.
2. Compare UI snapshots to authoritative records after each failure scenario.
3. Run component dependency checks, keyboard/screen-reader review, and visual regression tests.

### P07-GATE: Verify and accept P07

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P07-T01, P07-T02, P07-T03, P07-T04, P07-T05, P07-T06, P07-T07, P07-T08.

**Implementation plan**

1. Confirm every phase task and prerequisite is complete; inspect the actual deliverables and limitations rather than relying on a done label.
2. Run the phase's full acceptance, failure, preservation and rollback checks on the exact candidate and supported environments. Retain per-criterion evidence using gate-record.template.json.
3. Codex reviews actual deliverables and subagent findings and records the advancement decision. Parallelize bounded subagent work only within this phase. Missing evidence remains blocking; no human approval is required.
4. Commit all phase changes and evidence to feat/agentmux-platform-rearchitecture, push, and verify the remote commit. Record that commit before the next phase starts. MERGE-01 remains separate.

**Deliverables**

1. AG-UI event mapping
2. UI extension and accessibility reports
3. Dashboard before/after demonstration
4. Component reuse decisions, baseline/candidate results, gain evidence and approved exceptions for ADD-01

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P07-GATE-AC01: Refresh, reconnect, duplicate events, delayed events, and history gaps converge to the same authorized view without starting work.
2. P07-GATE-AC02: An unauthorized user cannot access another project's snapshots, streams, conversation, or artifact by guessing an ID.
3. P07-GATE-AC03: Every displayed completion or cancellation state distinguishes worker output from accepted/confirmed state.
4. P07-GATE-AC04: Domain UI contributions use versioned registered components. Core views remain usable when an optional plugin fails.
5. P07-GATE-AC05: Reusable component boundaries and accessibility checks pass for all launch views.
6. P07-GATE-AC06: All ten existing dashboard views and their actions, terminal streams, saved preferences, editor conflicts, themes and integration panels have reviewed before/after evidence. Existing capabilities remain reachable until their replacements pass; AG-UI and component restructuring do not authorize dropping controls.
7. P07-GATE-AC07: Terminal and dashboard status agree at the same source revision. Refresh and reconnect preserve explicit stale/unknown states, hide inaccessible hubs and do not start a second stack or grant additional control.
8. P07-GATE-AC08: All assigned failure scenarios and component checks have reviewed evidence for the candidate; missing or skipped required checks remain blocking.
9. P07-GATE-AC09: The required reviewer and advancement decision are recorded, and the phase commit is verified on the current remote feature branch. No merge is performed.

**Verification**

1. Run multi-viewer browser tests, revoked-session tests, stream replay, and network interruptions.
2. Compare UI snapshots to authoritative records after each failure scenario.
3. Run component dependency checks, keyboard/screen-reader review, and visual regression tests.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.
5. Compare terminal and dashboard status snapshots, versions and timestamps, including absent federation support, no configured hubs, denied scope and stale observations.

## P08. Jev decision services and measured efficiency

Plugins request bounded semantic advice with traceable evidence and safe fallback.

**Epic acceptance criteria**

- **P08-AC01:** Boot and core orchestration still work when Jev is disabled or unreachable, using documented fallbacks.
- **P08-AC02:** Jev cannot grant authority, mutate kernel state, invent tool success, transfer task ownership, or accept a result.
- **P08-AC03:** Cache keys bind tenant, scope, source/version, definition/model, and policy. Revoked sharing cannot return a cached restricted result.
- **P08-AC04:** All calls obey size/time/budget limits and account for failed/uncertain attempts. Replay of stored annotations makes no new paid call.
- **P08-AC05:** Each enabled definition passes its own labeled holdout criteria and workflow non-regression threshold before promotion.
- **P08-AC06:** Every affected existing component retains its documented behavior through reused code or a justified replacement. Its baseline and candidate checks, migration checks, and added capability evidence are reviewed before advancement. Missing environments remain open. Codex reviews intended behavior and migration changes against the full user scope; autonomous delivery does not authorize capability removal, reduced scope or weaker verification.

### P08-T06: Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P07-GATE.

**Implementation plan**

1. Review the phase-owned components in the preservation matrix and identify every changed caller, command, route, state record, integration and UI action; also include cross-phase callers affected by this work.
2. Record retain/wrap/extract/extend/replace decisions with reasons. Map each old assertion and data identity to its target. Capture missing characterization fixtures before refactoring.
3. Run the available baseline checks and define the candidate, migration/rollback and added-functionality checks. Candidate execution belongs to the implementation and final phase gate, so this preparation does not depend on future code being finished.
4. Maintain the inventory and behavior ownership throughout the phase. Missing environments stay open. Codex reviews any capability change against the complete user-authorized scope; autonomy does not permit silent scope reduction.

**Deliverables**

1. Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller. Record reuse, intentional behavior changes, migration needs and the specific added functionality before editing implementation.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P08-T06-AC01: Every phase-owned component and affected cross-phase caller has a recorded scope, existing behavior and owner; no changed source is unmapped.
2. P08-T06-AC02: Baseline evidence distinguishes passing, failing, unavailable and historical results. Any gap that prevents a safe planned change remains blocking.
3. P08-T06-AC03: Reuse and migration decisions name alternatives, preserved IDs/assertions and rollback boundaries; required approval exists before any capability reduction.
4. P08-T06-AC04: Candidate comparison, added-functionality and migration fixtures are assigned to implementation and phase verification tasks. This preflight does not claim that future candidate tests already passed.

### P08-VIDEO-E2: Portable, nested decision-definition packages

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P07-GATE, P08-T06.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the original proposal, related records, controls and evaluation gates preserved in sourceRecord. Identify shared implementations first; this record does not require a separate service, model call or additive savings claim.
2. Implement or extend a versioned definition/capability for: Portable, nested decision-definition packages
3. Preserve the item's exact source boundary, permissions and required facts. Use deterministic checks before optional inference, scoped evidence/cache identities, explicit abstention and bounded time/cost. Keep the feature disabled or advisory until qualified.
4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P08-VIDEO-E2-AC01: Parent defaults produce separately scoped children; a rubric override produces a new revision without widening grants.
2. P08-VIDEO-E2-AC02: Both independent and private children obey declared lifecycle/dependency rules; source credentials are absent from packages.
3. P08-VIDEO-E2-AC03: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
4. P08-VIDEO-E2-AC04: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

**Verification**

1. Run the item's required evaluation gates: EVAL-CONTRACT

**Original proposal and item-specific boundaries**

2. Implement or extend a versioned definition/capability for: Scoped decision records and replay views
3. Preserve the item's exact source boundary, permissions and required facts. Use deterministic checks before optional inference, scoped evidence/cache identities, explicit abstention and bounded time/cost. Keep the feature disabled or advisory until qualified.
4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P08-VIDEO-E4-AC01: Decision metadata crosses components through NATS and authorized UI projections through AG-UI.
2. P08-VIDEO-E4-AC02: A new viewer or replay issues no new inference; evidence bodies are not mirrored into unrestricted traces.
3. P08-VIDEO-E4-AC03: Authoritative state, model annotations and unknown billing remain distinguishable.
4. P08-VIDEO-E4-AC04: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
5. P08-VIDEO-E4-AC05: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

**Dependencies:** P08-T01, P08-T02, P08-T03, P08-T04, P08-T05, P08-T06, P08-VIDEO-E2, P08-VIDEO-E4.

**Implementation plan**

1. Confirm every phase task and prerequisite is complete; inspect the actual deliverables and limitations rather than relying on a done label.
2. Run the phase's full acceptance, failure, preservation and rollback checks on the exact candidate and supported environments. Retain per-criterion evidence using gate-record.template.json.
3. Codex reviews actual deliverables and subagent findings and records the advancement decision. Parallelize bounded subagent work only within this phase. Missing evidence remains blocking; no human approval is required.
4. Commit all phase changes and evidence to feat/agentmux-platform-rearchitecture, push, and verify the remote commit. Record that commit before the next phase starts. MERGE-01 remains separate.

**Deliverables**

1. Decision contracts and policy ledger
2. Definition-specific scorecards
3. Cost per accepted outcome and fallback report
4. Component reuse decisions, baseline/candidate results, gain evidence and approved exceptions for ADD-01

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P08-GATE-AC01: Boot and core orchestration still work when Jev is disabled or unreachable, using documented fallbacks.
2. P08-GATE-AC02: Jev cannot grant authority, mutate kernel state, invent tool success, transfer task ownership, or accept a result.
3. P08-GATE-AC03: Cache keys bind tenant, scope, source/version, definition/model, and policy. Revoked sharing cannot return a cached restricted result.
4. P08-GATE-AC04: All calls obey size/time/budget limits and account for failed/uncertain attempts. Replay of stored annotations makes no new paid call.
5. P08-GATE-AC05: Each enabled definition passes its own labeled holdout criteria and workflow non-regression threshold before promotion.
6. P08-GATE-AC06: Every affected existing component retains its documented behavior through reused code or a justified replacement. Its baseline and candidate checks, migration checks, and added capability evidence are reviewed before advancement. Missing environments remain open. Codex reviews intended behavior and migration changes against the full user scope; autonomous delivery does not authorize capability removal, reduced scope or weaker verification.
7. P08-GATE-AC07: All assigned failure scenarios and component checks have reviewed evidence for the candidate; missing or skipped required checks remain blocking.
8. P08-GATE-AC08: The required reviewer and advancement decision are recorded, and the phase commit is verified on the current remote feature branch. No merge is performed.

**Verification**

1. Run the existing synthetic examples and 44-case policy illustration as historical inputs, then extend with real service and NATS tests.
2. Evaluate with provider mocks for mechanics, separately with capped live calls for semantic quality after local token configuration and budget approval.
3. Compare deterministic baseline, Jev tools only, and tools plus skills on equivalent fresh tasks.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

## P09. Portable Jev plugin and first skill wave

The same Jev capabilities improve supported clients with host-specific packaging.

**Epic acceptance criteria**

- **P09-AC01:** All first-wave skills have a clear trigger, declared input/output, real use case, error/fallback behavior, and evaluation fixtures.
- **P09-AC02:** Whole-suite near-miss tests show skills do not compete unnecessarily or trigger a broad ask-everything path.
- **P09-AC03:** Every claimed host capability passes on that actual host. Unsupported hooks/compaction are declared.
- **P09-AC04:** Skills preserve counterevidence and required obligations and cannot override system permissions or invent authority.
- **P09-AC05:** Live semantic and end-to-end cost gates pass before the corresponding skill is enabled by default.
- **P09-AC06:** Every affected existing component retains its documented behavior through reused code or a justified replacement. Its baseline and candidate checks, migration checks, and added capability evidence are reviewed before advancement. Missing environments remain open. Codex reviews intended behavior and migration changes against the full user scope; autonomous delivery does not authorize capability removal, reduced scope or weaker verification.

### P09-T01: Build one shared Jev CLI/MCP runtime and portable skill content with separate Claude, Codex, Pi, and Desktop packaging.

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P08-GATE, P09-T06.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Build one shared Jev CLI/MCP runtime and portable skill content with separate Claude, Codex, Pi, and Desktop packaging.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.

**Deliverables**

1. Build one shared Jev CLI/MCP runtime and portable skill content with separate Claude, Codex, Pi, and Desktop packaging.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P09-T01-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Build one shared Jev CLI/MCP runtime and portable skill content with separate Claude, Codex, Pi, and Desktop packaging.
2. P09-T01-AC02: Every named capability in the scope has a passing focused check or a recorded, unresolved environment/decision gap. A gap prevents this task being marked done; a smaller successful example cannot stand in for the entire scope.
3. P09-T01-AC03: Affected existing behavior has a baseline/candidate comparison or an approved behavior-change record; no capability, required assertion or stored identity is silently removed.
4. P09-T01-AC04: Evidence identifies the candidate commit, actual environment, command and result for each task criterion; secrets and private agent reasoning are excluded. Known limitations, migration and recovery behavior are documented.

**Verification**

1. Run approximately 20 positive/near-miss trigger prompts per skill and representative task pairs plus shared boundary cases.
2. Use independent review and separate tuning/validation/release sets.
3. Measure skill discovery metadata overhead, context cost, accuracy, and accepted outcomes across hosts.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

### P09-T06: Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P08-GATE.

**Implementation plan**

1. Review the phase-owned components in the preservation matrix and identify every changed caller, command, route, state record, integration and UI action; also include cross-phase callers affected by this work.
2. Record retain/wrap/extract/extend/replace decisions with reasons. Map each old assertion and data identity to its target. Capture missing characterization fixtures before refactoring.
3. Run the available baseline checks and define the candidate, migration/rollback and added-functionality checks. Candidate execution belongs to the implementation and final phase gate, so this preparation does not depend on future code being finished.
4. Maintain the inventory and behavior ownership throughout the phase. Missing environments stay open. Codex reviews any capability change against the complete user-authorized scope; autonomy does not permit silent scope reduction.

**Deliverables**

1. Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller. Record reuse, intentional behavior changes, migration needs and the specific added functionality before editing implementation.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P09-T06-AC01: Every phase-owned component and affected cross-phase caller has a recorded scope, existing behavior and owner; no changed source is unmapped.
2. P09-T06-AC02: Baseline evidence distinguishes passing, failing, unavailable and historical results. Any gap that prevents a safe planned change remains blocking.
3. P09-T06-AC03: Reuse and migration decisions name alternatives, preserved IDs/assertions and rollback boundaries; required approval exists before any capability reduction.
4. P09-T06-AC04: Candidate comparison, added-functionality and migration fixtures are assigned to implementation and phase verification tasks. This preflight does not claim that future candidate tests already passed.

**Verification**

1. Run approximately 20 positive/near-miss trigger prompts per skill and representative task pairs plus shared boundary cases.
2. Use independent review and separate tuning/validation/release sets.
3. Measure skill discovery metadata overhead, context cost, accuracy, and accepted outcomes across hosts.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

### P09-JEV-001: Intent-to-handler selection

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P08-GATE, P09-T06.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the original proposal, related records, controls and evaluation gates preserved in sourceRecord. Identify shared implementations first; this record does not require a separate service, model call or additive savings claim.
2. Implement or extend a versioned definition/capability for: Intent-to-handler selection
3. Preserve the item's exact source boundary, permissions and required facts. Use deterministic checks before optional inference, scoped evidence/cache identities, explicit abstention and bounded time/cost. Keep the feature disabled or advisory until qualified.
4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P09-JEV-001-AC01: An ineligible or nonexistent option cannot be returned as an executable choice.
2. P09-JEV-001-AC02: Missing or inadequate candidates produce no-fit/unknown; exact routing/arithmetic uses code without an unnecessary Jev call.
3. P09-JEV-001-AC03: Preserve this item-specific boundary: Typed commands route directly without Jev; mutation authorization remains separate.
4. P09-JEV-001-AC04: Report Correct route and costly misroutes on representative untouched cases and complete accepted workflows, with baseline and failure slices.
5. P09-JEV-001-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
6. P09-JEV-001-AC06: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

**Verification**

1. Run the item's required evaluation gates: EVAL-CONTRACT, EVAL-SEMANTIC, EVAL-ECONOMICS

2. Implement or extend a versioned definition/capability for: Approved workflow selection
3. Preserve the item's exact source boundary, permissions and required facts. Use deterministic checks before optional inference, scoped evidence/cache identities, explicit abstention and bounded time/cost. Keep the feature disabled or advisory until qualified.
4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P09-JEV-008-AC01: An ineligible or nonexistent option cannot be returned as an executable choice.
2. P09-JEV-008-AC02: Missing or inadequate candidates produce no-fit/unknown; exact routing/arithmetic uses code without an unnecessary Jev call.
3. P09-JEV-008-AC03: Preserve this item-specific boundary: Workflow selection never grants permissions or removes required stages.
4. P09-JEV-008-AC04: Report Plan-generation calls avoided; workflow fit on representative untouched cases and complete accepted workflows, with baseline and failure slices.
5. P09-JEV-008-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
6. P09-JEV-008-AC06: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P09-JEV-026-AC01: Seed a small critical exception and contradiction in a large irrelevant source set; selected evidence preserves it or explicitly reports incomplete coverage.
2. P09-JEV-026-AC02: Partial/unreadable evidence does not become absent evidence; every returned span or artifact ID resolves to the evaluated version.
3. P09-JEV-026-AC03: Preserve this item-specific boundary: Relevance must not mean agreement; do not let a majority hide a critical exception.
4. P09-JEV-026-AC04: Report Contradiction recall on representative untouched cases and complete accepted workflows, with baseline and failure slices.
5. P09-JEV-026-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
6. P09-JEV-026-AC06: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P09-VIDEO-01-AC01: Reject disallowed evidence, malformed or oversized questions and exhausted budget before a provider call.
2. P09-VIDEO-01-AC02: Equivalent repeated self-confirmation questions stop or reuse a scoped record; the agent cannot author its own acceptance authority.
3. P09-VIDEO-01-AC03: Preserve source boundary: Validate question shape, permitted evidence references, option counts, budgets, deadlines and output size in code. Ad hoc answers remain advisory and cannot mint permissions or redefine task acceptance. Include an unknown outcome.
4. P09-VIDEO-01-AC04: Measure Accepted-task cost and completion time; useful-question rate; avoidable follow-up calls; repeated self-confirmation loops.
5. P09-VIDEO-01-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
6. P09-VIDEO-01-AC06: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

### P09-VIDEO-02: Questions about files without loading their contents

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P08-GATE, P09-T06.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the original proposal, related records, controls and evaluation gates preserved in sourceRecord. Identify shared implementations first; this record does not require a separate service, model call or additive savings claim.
2. Implement or extend a versioned definition/capability for: Questions about files without loading their contents
3. Preserve the item's exact source boundary, permissions and required facts. Use deterministic checks before optional inference, scoped evidence/cache identities, explicit abstention and bounded time/cost. Keep the feature disabled or advisory until qualified.

2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P09-VIDEO-02-AC01: Test allowed, denied, symlink-escaping, unreadable, truncated and stale files; every answer reports evidence revision and completeness.
2. P09-VIDEO-02-AC02: A needed full-source read remains possible without rerunning inference.
3. P09-VIDEO-02-AC03: Preserve source boundary: The evidence plugin still reads the file and may send it to a hosted provider. Apply source access and provider/export rules first, resolve paths safely, and distinguish absent evidence from unreadable, omitted or truncated input.
4. P09-VIDEO-02-AC04: Measure Main-model input avoided; answer error rate; later source-expansion rate; cache-adjusted total cost.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P09-VIDEO-08-AC01: Classify an immutable invocation artifact; provider timeout/retry creates zero additional executions.
2. P09-VIDEO-08-AC02: Exact exit/test statuses and original evidence remain retrievable; model label never converts failure into success.
3. P09-VIDEO-08-AC03: Preserve source boundary: Prefer an existing invocation/artifact reference to an unrestricted command string. Tests can execute arbitrary project code; a read-only label is insufficient. Authorization, execution and judgment are separate. Retries classify the existing result without rerunning the command.
4. P09-VIDEO-08-AC04: Measure Log tokens avoided; diagnosis accuracy; expansion frequency; zero duplicate executions.

1. Inspect the original proposal, related records, controls and evaluation gates preserved in sourceRecord. Identify shared implementations first; this record does not require a separate service, model call or additive savings claim.
2. Use the skill-creator workflow to author the declared trigger, inputs, outputs, use case, safe failure behavior and host-specific packaging: jev-scout
3. Preserve the item's exact source boundary, permissions and required facts. Use deterministic checks before optional inference, scoped evidence/cache identities, explicit abstention and bounded time/cost. Keep the feature disabled or advisory until qualified.
4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P09-jev-scout-AC01: Finds required sources; reports skipped and unreadable files; respects path/data scope; exposes a source-expansion path.
2. P09-jev-scout-AC02: Suite-wide positive/near-miss/no-inference prompts choose the intended workflow without loading unrelated full skill bodies.
3. P09-jev-scout-AC03: Paired ordinary-workflow/tools-only/tools-plus-skill results meet declared quality targets on an untouched release set for each supported host.
4. P09-jev-scout-AC04: Sources, tools and provider failures retain scope, outcome and evidence semantics; no silent direct-provider or native-hook fallback.
5. P09-jev-scout-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
6. P09-jev-scout-AC06: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

**Verification**

1. Run the item's required evaluation gates: EVAL-CONTRACT, EVAL-SKILL, EVAL-SEMANTIC, EVAL-ECONOMICS, EVAL-HOST

**Implementation plan**

1. Confirm every phase task and prerequisite is complete; inspect the actual deliverables and limitations rather than relying on a done label.
2. Run the phase's full acceptance, failure, preservation and rollback checks on the exact candidate and supported environments. Retain per-criterion evidence using gate-record.template.json.
3. Codex reviews actual deliverables and subagent findings and records the advancement decision. Parallelize bounded subagent work only within this phase. Missing evidence remains blocking; no human approval is required.
4. Commit all phase changes and evidence to feat/agentmux-platform-rearchitecture, push, and verify the remote commit. Record that commit before the next phase starts. MERGE-01 remains separate.

**Deliverables**

1. Host packages and skill catalog
2. Paired skill-creator evaluation reports
3. Cross-host conformance and release holdout
4. Component reuse decisions, baseline/candidate results, gain evidence and approved exceptions for ADD-01

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P09-GATE-AC01: All first-wave skills have a clear trigger, declared input/output, real use case, error/fallback behavior, and evaluation fixtures.
2. P09-GATE-AC02: Whole-suite near-miss tests show skills do not compete unnecessarily or trigger a broad ask-everything path.
3. P09-GATE-AC03: Every claimed host capability passes on that actual host. Unsupported hooks/compaction are declared.
4. P09-GATE-AC04: Skills preserve counterevidence and required obligations and cannot override system permissions or invent authority.
5. P09-GATE-AC05: Live semantic and end-to-end cost gates pass before the corresponding skill is enabled by default.
6. P09-GATE-AC06: Every affected existing component retains its documented behavior through reused code or a justified replacement. Its baseline and candidate checks, migration checks, and added capability evidence are reviewed before advancement. Missing environments remain open. Codex reviews intended behavior and migration changes against the full user scope; autonomous delivery does not authorize capability removal, reduced scope or weaker verification.
7. P09-GATE-AC07: All assigned failure scenarios and component checks have reviewed evidence for the candidate; missing or skipped required checks remain blocking.
8. P09-GATE-AC08: The required reviewer and advancement decision are recorded, and the phase commit is verified on the current remote feature branch. No merge is performed.

**Verification**

1. Run approximately 20 positive/near-miss trigger prompts per skill and representative task pairs plus shared boundary cases.
2. Use independent review and separate tuning/validation/release sets.
3. Measure skill discovery metadata overhead, context cost, accuracy, and accepted outcomes across hosts.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

## P10. Connected hubs, leaf nodes, and cross-organization work

Independent teams share authorized work while retaining their own authority.

**Epic acceptance criteria**

- **P10-AC01:** Same-organization and cross-organization reference workflows both finish with origin-owned result acceptance.
- **P10-AC02:** Accepted work stays reserved while disconnected. Missing acceptance acknowledgment remains ambiguous until reconciled, never automatically redispatched.
- **P10-AC03:** Duplicate offer/result delivery creates one delegation/attempt outcome. Wrong executor, project, repository, or task version is rejected. Stale grants cannot authorize new effects. Authenticated historical results from previously authorized reserved work are retained for reconciliation or quarantine when current policy requires it; grant expiry cannot erase the obligation or its evidence.
- **P10-AC04:** Unauthorized accounts cannot subscribe to private project subjects or fetch protected artifacts. Transitive hub connectivity grants no access.
- **P10-AC05:** Reconnect recovers progress/results and durable revocations. A stop request is not reported as execution stopped until confirmed or clearly unknown.
- **P10-AC06:** A leaf outage and independent local persistence produce the agreed offline behavior without treating broker connectivity as shared ownership.
- **P10-AC07:** After a partition, mirror lag, retention gap or restoration of an older origin snapshot, hubs reconcile authoritative task and execution records before admitting overlapping work. Replication never grants write authority, and accepted or acceptance-unknown work remains reserved.
- **P10-AC08:** Migration fixtures retain current hub verbs, five federation plugins, pending outbox/quarantine records, seen IDs, durable consumer positions, shared-board revisions, knowledge search/capture and code pointers. Existing account, credential and ACL installations have an approved migration path.
- **P10-AC09:** Startup and refreshed summaries distinguish connected, disconnected, stale, unknown and not-configured hubs at the caller scope. A partition cannot appear as healthy federation, expose another tenant or release reserved work; broker reachability alone does not establish usable partner capacity.

### P10-T01: Extend current federation capability

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P09-GATE, P10-T09.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Extend current federation capability. Move one recorded protocol and persistence boundary at a time, preserving existing messages, work, board, knowledge, code and deployment administration workflows.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.

**Deliverables**

1. Extend current federation capability. Move one recorded protocol and persistence boundary at a time, preserving existing messages, work, board, knowledge, code and deployment administration workflows.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P10-T01-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Extend current federation capability. Move one recorded protocol and persistence boundary at a time, preserving existing messages, work, board, knowledge, code and deployment administration workflows.
2. P10-T01-AC02: Every named capability in the scope has a passing focused check or a recorded, unresolved environment/decision gap. A gap prevents this task being marked done; a smaller successful example cannot stand in for the entire scope.
3. P10-T01-AC03: Affected existing behavior has a baseline/candidate comparison or an approved behavior-change record; no capability, required assertion or stored identity is silently removed.
4. P10-T01-AC04: Evidence identifies the candidate commit, actual environment, command and result for each task criterion; secrets and private agent reasoning are excluded. Known limitations, migration and recovery behavior are documented.

**Verification**

1. Run at least three hubs and two independently administered organizations with real accounts/leaf links and isolated stores.
2. Inject partitions before/after offer acceptance, drop replies, duplicate deliveries, restart hubs, expire/revoke grants, and alter task versions.
3. Exercise explicit cancel/reassign with a possibly running old worker and document unavoidable external-effect uncertainty.
4. Snapshot the origin before a remote acceptance, let the receiver accept and continue, restore that older origin snapshot, and require reconciliation before overlapping admission. Verify one reservation and no duplicate execution.

### P10-T02: Implement scoped trust agreements, node/peer enrollment, NATS leaf topology, independent JetStream domains where needed, and selective sharing/replication.

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P09-GATE, P10-T09.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Implement scoped trust agreements, node/peer enrollment, NATS leaf topology, independent JetStream domains where needed, and selective sharing/replication.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.
6. Preserve the assertions assigned to this task for AMX-BASE-001 in delivery/evidence/P00/baseline-findings.md. Re-run or port the actual fixtures at the changed authority boundary; preserve explicitly open broader acceptance requirements.

**Deliverables**

1. Implement scoped trust agreements, node/peer enrollment, NATS leaf topology, independent JetStream domains where needed, and selective sharing/replication.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P10-T02-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Implement scoped trust agreements, node/peer enrollment, NATS leaf topology, independent JetStream domains where needed, and selective sharing/replication.
2. P10-T02-AC02: Every named capability in the scope has a passing focused check or a recorded, unresolved environment/decision gap. A gap prevents this task being marked done; a smaller successful example cannot stand in for the entire scope.
3. P10-T02-AC03: Affected existing behavior has a baseline/candidate comparison or an approved behavior-change record; no capability, required assertion or stored identity is silently removed.
4. P10-T02-AC04: Evidence identifies the candidate commit, actual environment, command and result for each task criterion; secrets and private agent reasoning are excluded. Known limitations, migration and recovery behavior are documented.

**Verification**

1. Run at least three hubs and two independently administered organizations with real accounts/leaf links and isolated stores.
2. Inject partitions before/after offer acceptance, drop replies, duplicate deliveries, restart hubs, expire/revoke grants, and alter task versions.
3. Exercise explicit cancel/reassign with a possibly running old worker and document unavoidable external-effect uncertainty.
4. Snapshot the origin before a remote acceptance, let the receiver accept and continue, restore that older origin snapshot, and require reconciliation before overlapping admission. Verify one reservation and no duplicate execution.
5. Disconnect beyond configured stream-retention and deduplication horizons using short test limits, then prune, restart, and reconnect. Require gap detection, snapshot/reconciliation or explicit intervention, preserved reservations, and no duplicate effects.
6. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

### P10-T09: Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P09-GATE.

**Implementation plan**

1. Review the phase-owned components in the preservation matrix and identify every changed caller, command, route, state record, integration and UI action; also include cross-phase callers affected by this work.
2. Record retain/wrap/extract/extend/replace decisions with reasons. Map each old assertion and data identity to its target. Capture missing characterization fixtures before refactoring.
3. Run the available baseline checks and define the candidate, migration/rollback and added-functionality checks. Candidate execution belongs to the implementation and final phase gate, so this preparation does not depend on future code being finished.
4. Maintain the inventory and behavior ownership throughout the phase. Missing environments stay open. Codex reviews any capability change against the complete user-authorized scope; autonomy does not permit silent scope reduction.

**Deliverables**

1. Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller. Record reuse, intentional behavior changes, migration needs and the specific added functionality before editing implementation.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P10-T09-AC01: Every phase-owned component and affected cross-phase caller has a recorded scope, existing behavior and owner; no changed source is unmapped.
2. P10-T09-AC02: Baseline evidence distinguishes passing, failing, unavailable and historical results. Any gap that prevents a safe planned change remains blocking.
3. P10-T09-AC03: Reuse and migration decisions name alternatives, preserved IDs/assertions and rollback boundaries; required approval exists before any capability reduction.
4. P10-T09-AC04: Candidate comparison, added-functionality and migration fixtures are assigned to implementation and phase verification tasks. This preflight does not claim that future candidate tests already passed.

**Verification**

1. Run at least three hubs and two independently administered organizations with real accounts/leaf links and isolated stores.
2. Inject partitions before/after offer acceptance, drop replies, duplicate deliveries, restart hubs, expire/revoke grants, and alter task versions.
3. Exercise explicit cancel/reassign with a possibly running old worker and document unavoidable external-effect uncertainty.
4. Snapshot the origin before a remote acceptance, let the receiver accept and continue, restore that older origin snapshot, and require reconciliation before overlapping admission. Verify one reservation and no duplicate execution.
5. Disconnect beyond configured stream-retention and deduplication horizons using short test limits, then prune, restart, and reconnect. Require gap detection, snapshot/reconciliation or explicit intervention, preserved reservations, and no duplicate effects.
6. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

### P10-JEV-010: Acceptance-criterion ambiguity

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P09-GATE, P10-T09.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the original proposal, related records, controls and evaluation gates preserved in sourceRecord. Identify shared implementations first; this record does not require a separate service, model call or additive savings claim.
2. Implement or extend a versioned definition/capability for: Acceptance-criterion ambiguity
3. Preserve the item's exact source boundary, permissions and required facts. Use deterministic checks before optional inference, scoped evidence/cache identities, explicit abstention and bounded time/cost. Keep the feature disabled or advisory until qualified.
4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P10-JEV-010-AC01: Seed supported, unsupported, contradictory and insufficient-evidence cases; report per-class confusion and independent evidence.
2. P10-JEV-010-AC02: A positive judgment cannot manufacture passing tests, verify a claim by repetition or waive the authoritative acceptance criteria.
3. P10-JEV-010-AC03: Preserve this item-specific boundary: Jev flags the issue; a user or generator writes revised criteria.
4. P10-JEV-010-AC04: Report Reopened work; clarification usefulness on representative untouched cases and complete accepted workflows, with baseline and failure slices.
5. P10-JEV-010-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
6. P10-JEV-010-AC06: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

**Verification**

1. Run the item's required evaluation gates: EVAL-CONTRACT, EVAL-SEMANTIC, EVAL-ECONOMICS, EVAL-EVIDENCE, EVAL-FEDERATION

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P10-VIDEO-05-AC01: Deny confidential membership/existence questions and unauthorized provider destinations before inference.

3. P10-VIDEO-05-AC03: Preserve source boundary: A typed answer can disclose confidential facts. Receiver-controlled query templates, output policy, quotas and provider permission are required. Evaluation at Hub B does not imply a local Jev model. Unavailable is not no; origin ownership and reserved disconnected work are unaffected.
4. P10-VIDEO-05-AC04: Measure Bytes and downstream tokens per useful result; relevance recall; latency; unauthorized-inference tests.
5. P10-VIDEO-05-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P10-VIDEO-12-AC01: Reviewed bilateral fixtures distinguish offline compilation from simulator evidence and flag missing named versions or acceptance artifacts.
2. P10-VIDEO-12-AC02: Semantic agreement never signs trust, transfers final acceptance or permits an operation; disagreements retain both source statements.
3. P10-VIDEO-12-AC03: Preserve source boundary: Versions, schema fields and permissions are checked in code. A model finding does not sign a trust agreement, expand scope, approve industrial operations or accept the final result.
4. P10-VIDEO-12-AC04: Measure Clarifications before execution; rejected deliveries; rework hours; added negotiation latency.

### P10-GATE: Verify and accept P10

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P10-T01, P10-T02, P10-T03, P10-T04, P10-T05, P10-T06, P10-T07, P10-T08, P10-T09, P10-T10, P10-JEV-010, P10-JEV-032, P10-JEV-043, P10-VIDEO-05, P10-VIDEO-12, P10-agentmux-jev-delegate, P10-agentmux-jev-inspect-hub, P10-agentmux-jev-review-results.

**Implementation plan**

1. Confirm every phase task and prerequisite is complete; inspect the actual deliverables and limitations rather than relying on a done label.
2. Run the phase's full acceptance, failure, preservation and rollback checks on the exact candidate and supported environments. Retain per-criterion evidence using gate-record.template.json.
3. Codex reviews actual deliverables and subagent findings and records the advancement decision. Parallelize bounded subagent work only within this phase. Missing evidence remains blocking; no human approval is required.
4. Commit all phase changes and evidence to feat/agentmux-platform-rearchitecture, push, and verify the remote commit. Record that commit before the next phase starts. MERGE-01 remains separate.

**Deliverables**

1. Federation state-machine and authority tests
2. Partition/reconciliation matrix
3. Cross-organization demo with auditable evidence
4. Independent-domain storage, retention-gap and older-origin recovery reports
5. Component reuse decisions, baseline/candidate results, gain evidence and approved exceptions for ADD-01

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P10-GATE-AC01: Same-organization and cross-organization reference workflows both finish with origin-owned result acceptance.
2. P10-GATE-AC02: Accepted work stays reserved while disconnected. Missing acceptance acknowledgment remains ambiguous until reconciled, never automatically redispatched.
3. P10-GATE-AC03: Duplicate offer/result delivery creates one delegation/attempt outcome. Wrong executor, project, repository, or task version is rejected. Stale grants cannot authorize new effects. Authenticated historical results from previously authorized reserved work are retained for reconciliation or quarantine when current policy requires it; grant expiry cannot erase the obligation or its evidence.
4. P10-GATE-AC04: Unauthorized accounts cannot subscribe to private project subjects or fetch protected artifacts. Transitive hub connectivity grants no access.
5. P10-GATE-AC05: Reconnect recovers progress/results and durable revocations. A stop request is not reported as execution stopped until confirmed or clearly unknown.
6. P10-GATE-AC06: A leaf outage and independent local persistence produce the agreed offline behavior without treating broker connectivity as shared ownership.
7. P10-GATE-AC07: After a partition, mirror lag, retention gap or restoration of an older origin snapshot, hubs reconcile authoritative task and execution records before admitting overlapping work. Replication never grants write authority, and accepted or acceptance-unknown work remains reserved.
8. P10-GATE-AC08: Migration fixtures retain current hub verbs, five federation plugins, pending outbox/quarantine records, seen IDs, durable consumer positions, shared-board revisions, knowledge search/capture and code pointers. Existing account, credential and ACL installations have an approved migration path.
9. P10-GATE-AC09: Startup and refreshed summaries distinguish connected, disconnected, stale, unknown and not-configured hubs at the caller scope. A partition cannot appear as healthy federation, expose another tenant or release reserved work; broker reachability alone does not establish usable partner capacity.
10. P10-GATE-AC10: All assigned failure scenarios and component checks have reviewed evidence for the candidate; missing or skipped required checks remain blocking.
11. P10-GATE-AC11: The required reviewer and advancement decision are recorded, and the phase commit is verified on the current remote feature branch. No merge is performed.

**Verification**

1. Run at least three hubs and two independently administered organizations with real accounts/leaf links and isolated stores.
2. Inject partitions before/after offer acceptance, drop replies, duplicate deliveries, restart hubs, expire/revoke grants, and alter task versions.
3. Exercise explicit cancel/reassign with a possibly running old worker and document unavoidable external-effect uncertainty.
4. Snapshot the origin before a remote acceptance, let the receiver accept and continue, restore that older origin snapshot, and require reconciliation before overlapping admission. Verify one reservation and no duplicate execution.
5. Disconnect beyond configured stream-retention and deduplication horizons using short test limits, then prune, restart, and reconnect. Require gap detection, snapshot/reconciliation or explicit intervention, preserved reservations, and no duplicate effects.
6. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.
7. Exercise FAIL-62 against two real hubs across reconnect, grant change and outage; compare terminal/dashboard snapshots and retained reservations.

## P11. Industrial and vendor extension packages

Industrial workflows extend Agentmux through the same contracts as other domains.

**Epic acceptance criteria**

- **P11-AC01:** A selected industrial workflow completes through client, orchestration, tool plugin, evidence, and dashboard without kernel or generic task-model changes.
- **P11-AC02:** Standalone and nested installation of selected domain children behave as declared.
- **P11-AC03:** Every migrated existing integration has a parity/deprecation record, tested tool/platform matrix, and explicit missing capability status.
- **P11-AC04:** Equipment writes require the correct target/action/operation grant and any applicable human approval at the owning tool endpoint.
- **P11-AC05:** A vendor adapter passes with the actual required tool or a clearly labeled simulator. Simulated success is never sold as hardware qualification.
- **P11-AC06:** Every existing protocol, standalone library, CLI and dashboard integration has individual behavior evidence, including bounds and supported host/target versions. Narrowing the first demonstration does not retire an existing capability.

### P11-T01: Package industrial orchestration guidance, tools, schemas, UI renderers, and skills with explicitly independent or parent-owned children.

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P10-GATE, P11-T07.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Package industrial orchestration guidance, tools, schemas, UI renderers, and skills with explicitly independent or parent-owned children.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.

**Deliverables**

1. Package industrial orchestration guidance, tools, schemas, UI renderers, and skills with explicitly independent or parent-owned children.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P11-T01-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Package industrial orchestration guidance, tools, schemas, UI renderers, and skills with explicitly independent or parent-owned children.
2. P11-T01-AC02: Every named capability in the scope has a passing focused check or a recorded, unresolved environment/decision gap. A gap prevents this task being marked done; a smaller successful example cannot stand in for the entire scope.
3. P11-T01-AC03: Affected existing behavior has a baseline/candidate comparison or an approved behavior-change record; no capability, required assertion or stored identity is silently removed.
4. P11-T01-AC04: Evidence identifies the candidate commit, actual environment, command and result for each task criterion; secrets and private agent reasoning are excluded. Known limitations, migration and recovery behavior are documented.

**Verification**

1. Use protocol simulators and recorded fixtures, then controlled hardware/vendor environments for supported claims.
2. Test wrong device/project/version, timeout, partial writes, lost replies, credential failure, and disconnected grants.
3. Demonstrate missing Windows-native prerequisites as an actionable unsupported environment, not silent fallback.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

### P11-T06: Inventory existing PCM600/ABB-related privilege hooks as integration requirements, preserving target/action confirmation and audit

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P10-GATE, P11-T07.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Inventory existing PCM600/ABB-related privilege hooks as integration requirements, preserving target/action confirmation and audit. Do not infer a complete vendor adapter from the existence of a guard hook.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.

### P11-T07: Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P10-GATE.

**Implementation plan**

1. Review the phase-owned components in the preservation matrix and identify every changed caller, command, route, state record, integration and UI action; also include cross-phase callers affected by this work.
2. Record retain/wrap/extract/extend/replace decisions with reasons. Map each old assertion and data identity to its target. Capture missing characterization fixtures before refactoring.
3. Run the available baseline checks and define the candidate, migration/rollback and added-functionality checks. Candidate execution belongs to the implementation and final phase gate, so this preparation does not depend on future code being finished.
4. Maintain the inventory and behavior ownership throughout the phase. Missing environments stay open. Codex reviews any capability change against the complete user-authorized scope; autonomy does not permit silent scope reduction.

**Deliverables**

1. Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller. Record reuse, intentional behavior changes, migration needs and the specific added functionality before editing implementation.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P11-T07-AC01: Every phase-owned component and affected cross-phase caller has a recorded scope, existing behavior and owner; no changed source is unmapped.
2. P11-T07-AC02: Baseline evidence distinguishes passing, failing, unavailable and historical results. Any gap that prevents a safe planned change remains blocking.
3. P11-T07-AC03: Reuse and migration decisions name alternatives, preserved IDs/assertions and rollback boundaries; required approval exists before any capability reduction.
4. P11-T07-AC04: Candidate comparison, added-functionality and migration fixtures are assigned to implementation and phase verification tasks. This preflight does not claim that future candidate tests already passed.

**Verification**

1. Use protocol simulators and recorded fixtures, then controlled hardware/vendor environments for supported claims.
2. Test wrong device/project/version, timeout, partial writes, lost replies, credential failure, and disconnected grants.
3. Demonstrate missing Windows-native prerequisites as an actionable unsupported environment, not silent fallback.

### P11-JEV-068: Engineering vendor/workflow selection

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P10-GATE, P11-T07.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the original proposal, related records, controls and evaluation gates preserved in sourceRecord. Identify shared implementations first; this record does not require a separate service, model call or additive savings claim.
2. Implement or extend a versioned definition/capability for: Engineering vendor/workflow selection
3. Preserve the item's exact source boundary, permissions and required facts. Use deterministic checks before optional inference, scoped evidence/cache identities, explicit abstention and bounded time/cost. Keep the feature disabled or advisory until qualified.
4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P11-JEV-068-AC01: An ineligible or nonexistent option cannot be returned as an executable choice.
2. P11-JEV-068-AC02: Missing or inadequate candidates produce no-fit/unknown; exact routing/arithmetic uses code without an unnecessary Jev call.
3. P11-JEV-068-AC03: Preserve this item-specific boundary: Exact product/version/platform compatibility and allowed operations use declarations.
4. P11-JEV-068-AC04: Report Wrong-tool avoidance and instruction tokens on representative untouched cases and complete accepted workflows, with baseline and failure slices.
5. P11-JEV-068-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
6. P11-JEV-068-AC06: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

**Verification**

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P11-JEV-070-AC01: An ineligible or nonexistent option cannot be returned as an executable choice.
2. P11-JEV-070-AC02: Missing or inadequate candidates produce no-fit/unknown; exact routing/arithmetic uses code without an unnecessary Jev call.
3. P11-JEV-070-AC03: Preserve this item-specific boundary: Exact address, type, units, and equipment identity are independently checked.
4. P11-JEV-070-AC04: Report Mapping precision and review effort on representative untouched cases and complete accepted workflows, with baseline and failure slices.
5. P11-JEV-070-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
6. P11-JEV-070-AC06: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

2. Use the skill-creator workflow to author the declared trigger, inputs, outputs, use case, safe failure behavior and host-specific packaging: industrial-jev-evidence
3. Preserve the item's exact source boundary, permissions and required facts. Use deterministic checks before optional inference, scoped evidence/cache identities, explicit abstention and bounded time/cost. Keep the feature disabled or advisory until qualified.
4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P11-industrial-jev-evidence-AC01: Does not invent observations, certify equipment safety or sign off commissioning.
2. P11-industrial-jev-evidence-AC02: Suite-wide positive/near-miss/no-inference prompts choose the intended workflow without loading unrelated full skill bodies.
3. P11-industrial-jev-evidence-AC03: Paired ordinary-workflow/tools-only/tools-plus-skill results meet declared quality targets on an untouched release set for each supported host.
4. P11-industrial-jev-evidence-AC04: Sources, tools and provider failures retain scope, outcome and evidence semantics; no silent direct-provider or native-hook fallback.
5. P11-industrial-jev-evidence-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
6. P11-industrial-jev-evidence-AC06: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

**Verification**

1. Run the item's required evaluation gates: EVAL-CONTRACT, EVAL-SKILL, EVAL-SEMANTIC, EVAL-ECONOMICS, EVAL-HOST, EVAL-INDUSTRIAL

**Original proposal and item-specific boundaries**

```json
{
  "name": "industrial-jev-evidence",
  "description": "Map engineering requirements to supplied test and commissioning evidence and identify missing or contradictory coverage.",
  "useCase": "Find acceptance requirements that lack corresponding observations in a commissioning packet.",

### P11-GATE: Verify and accept P11

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P11-T01, P11-T02, P11-T03, P11-T04, P11-T05, P11-T06, P11-T07, P11-JEV-068, P11-JEV-069, P11-JEV-070, P11-JEV-071, P11-JEV-072, P11-JEV-073, P11-JEV-074, P11-JEV-086, P11-JEV-088, P11-industrial-jev-build, P11-industrial-jev-migration, P11-industrial-jev-evidence.

**Implementation plan**

1. Confirm every phase task and prerequisite is complete; inspect the actual deliverables and limitations rather than relying on a done label.
2. Run the phase's full acceptance, failure, preservation and rollback checks on the exact candidate and supported environments. Retain per-criterion evidence using gate-record.template.json.
3. Codex reviews actual deliverables and subagent findings and records the advancement decision. Parallelize bounded subagent work only within this phase. Missing evidence remains blocking; no human approval is required.
4. Commit all phase changes and evidence to feat/agentmux-platform-rearchitecture, push, and verify the remote commit. Record that commit before the next phase starts. MERGE-01 remains separate.

**Deliverables**

1. Domain package and vendor compatibility matrix
2. Industrial workflow and permission report
3. Protocol parity and hardware qualification records
4. Component reuse decisions, baseline/candidate results, gain evidence and approved exceptions for ADD-01

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P11-GATE-AC01: A selected industrial workflow completes through client, orchestration, tool plugin, evidence, and dashboard without kernel or generic task-model changes.
2. P11-GATE-AC02: Standalone and nested installation of selected domain children behave as declared.
3. P11-GATE-AC03: Every migrated existing integration has a parity/deprecation record, tested tool/platform matrix, and explicit missing capability status.
4. P11-GATE-AC04: Equipment writes require the correct target/action/operation grant and any applicable human approval at the owning tool endpoint.
5. P11-GATE-AC05: A vendor adapter passes with the actual required tool or a clearly labeled simulator. Simulated success is never sold as hardware qualification.
6. P11-GATE-AC06: Every existing protocol, standalone library, CLI and dashboard integration has individual behavior evidence, including bounds and supported host/target versions. Narrowing the first demonstration does not retire an existing capability.
7. P11-GATE-AC07: All assigned failure scenarios and component checks have reviewed evidence for the candidate; missing or skipped required checks remain blocking.
8. P11-GATE-AC08: The required reviewer and advancement decision are recorded, and the phase commit is verified on the current remote feature branch. No merge is performed.

**Verification**

1. Use protocol simulators and recorded fixtures, then controlled hardware/vendor environments for supported claims.
2. Test wrong device/project/version, timeout, partial writes, lost replies, credential failure, and disconnected grants.
3. Demonstrate missing Windows-native prerequisites as an actionable unsupported environment, not silent fallback.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

## P12. Production hardening and first sellable release

Customers can install, operate, recover, and support the complete launch product.

**Epic acceptance criteria**

- **P12-AC01:** Every launch requirement is linked to passing evidence for the exact release candidate. Critical correctness/security defects are closed.
- **P12-AC02:** A new developer installs and completes the reference task using only published docs on every supported platform.
- **P12-AC03:** A team administrator enrolls two organizations, shares a scoped project, delegates work, survives a partition, and restores a backup.
- **P12-AC04:** The approved capacity/SLO targets and recovery drill pass without losing acknowledged durable records within the tested fault model.
- **P12-AC05:** Codex reviews release-readiness evidence and records provisional readiness plus all outstanding MERGE-01 requirements. P12 acceptance does not authorize merge or release; final branch acceptance requires every phase and safe bilateral orchestration between independently enrolled, agent-operated real hubs on the exact candidate.
- **P12-AC06:** The approved NATS storage profile passes record/checkpoint/artifact restore, projection rebuild, retention-gap and migration rollback drills under the declared process/host/disk/quorum failure model. Published RPO/RTO and capacity claims match observed evidence, and no unreviewed SQL authority remains.
- **P12-AC07:** Every component and behavior check has a reviewed release disposition. Required baseline/candidate comparisons and migration drills pass on the supported matrix; no skipped check, missing component or unapproved feature removal can be hidden by a successful new reference workflow.
- **P12-AC08:** Fresh-user and upgrade drills pass LOCAL-01 cold/warm/concurrent startup, actionable Docker failures, explicit stop, persistent data recovery and scoped hub status on the supported platform/client matrix. No launch silently upgrades an incompatible live stack, loses durable work or bypasses a required phase gate.

### P12-T01: Finish signed/reproducible distributions, dependency locks/SBOM, versioned configuration, upgrade/rollback, package verification, and support diagnostics.

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P11-GATE, P12-T08.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Finish signed/reproducible distributions, dependency locks/SBOM, versioned configuration, upgrade/rollback, package verification, and support diagnostics.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.

**Deliverables**

1. Finish signed/reproducible distributions, dependency locks/SBOM, versioned configuration, upgrade/rollback, package verification, and support diagnostics.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

2. P12-T01-AC02: Every named capability in the scope has a passing focused check or a recorded, unresolved environment/decision gap. A gap prevents this task being marked done; a smaller successful example cannot stand in for the entire scope.
3. P12-T01-AC03: Affected existing behavior has a baseline/candidate comparison or an approved behavior-change record; no capability, required assertion or stored identity is silently removed.
4. P12-T01-AC04: Evidence identifies the candidate commit, actual environment, command and result for each task criterion; secrets and private agent reasoning are excluded. Known limitations, migration and recovery behavior are documented.

**Verification**

1. Run the complete release matrix, independent security review, load/soak tests, upgrade/restore rehearsal, and pilot acceptance.
2. Compare evidence manifests to the exact candidate digest and invalidate stale results after material changes.
3. Review support and commercial readiness with accountable owners.
4. Run qualified storage failure and recovery drills with pinned disk/sync/replication settings, including capacity exhaustion. Verify restored reservations before processing queued commands.
5. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.
6. Repeat FAIL-55–FAIL-62 with the exact packaged release, real federation and each advertised launch integration; record readiness deadlines, versions, volume identity and observed timing.
7. Review MERGE-01 evidence completeness and remaining required phases. Rehearsals may happen here, but repeat the final run on the exact final branch candidate after all required phases pass.

**Implementation plan**

1. Review the phase-owned components in the preservation matrix and identify every changed caller, command, route, state record, integration and UI action; also include cross-phase callers affected by this work.
2. Record retain/wrap/extract/extend/replace decisions with reasons. Map each old assertion and data identity to its target. Capture missing characterization fixtures before refactoring.
3. Run the available baseline checks and define the candidate, migration/rollback and added-functionality checks. Candidate execution belongs to the implementation and final phase gate, so this preparation does not depend on future code being finished.
4. Maintain the inventory and behavior ownership throughout the phase. Missing environments stay open. Codex reviews any capability change against the complete user-authorized scope; autonomy does not permit silent scope reduction.

**Deliverables**

1. Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller. Record reuse, intentional behavior changes, migration needs and the specific added functionality before editing implementation.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P12-T08-AC01: Every phase-owned component and affected cross-phase caller has a recorded scope, existing behavior and owner; no changed source is unmapped.
2. P12-T08-AC02: Baseline evidence distinguishes passing, failing, unavailable and historical results. Any gap that prevents a safe planned change remains blocking.
3. P12-T08-AC03: Reuse and migration decisions name alternatives, preserved IDs/assertions and rollback boundaries; required approval exists before any capability reduction.
4. P12-T08-AC04: Candidate comparison, added-functionality and migration fixtures are assigned to implementation and phase verification tasks. This preflight does not claim that future candidate tests already passed.

**Verification**

1. Run the complete release matrix, independent security review, load/soak tests, upgrade/restore rehearsal, and pilot acceptance.
2. Compare evidence manifests to the exact candidate digest and invalidate stale results after material changes.
3. Review support and commercial readiness with accountable owners.
4. Run qualified storage failure and recovery drills with pinned disk/sync/replication settings, including capacity exhaustion. Verify restored reservations before processing queued commands.
5. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.
6. Repeat FAIL-55–FAIL-62 with the exact packaged release, real federation and each advertised launch integration; record readiness deadlines, versions, volume identity and observed timing.
7. Review MERGE-01 evidence completeness and remaining required phases. Rehearsals may happen here, but repeat the final run on the exact final branch candidate after all required phases pass.

### P12-T09: Qualify LOCAL-01 installation, automatic launch, upgrade compatibility, data retention and recovery using the pinned Docker/Compose/OS/client matrix

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P11-GATE, P12-T08.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Qualify LOCAL-01 installation, automatic launch, upgrade compatibility, data retention and recovery using the pinned Docker/Compose/OS/client matrix. Document setup prerequisites, diagnosis, explicit stop and backup/restore without making runtime Docker socket access a general plugin capability.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.

**Deliverables**

1. Qualify LOCAL-01 installation, automatic launch, upgrade compatibility, data retention and recovery using the pinned Docker/Compose/OS/client matrix. Document setup prerequisites, diagnosis, explicit stop and backup/restore without making runtime Docker socket access a general plugin capability.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P12-T09-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Qualify LOCAL-01 installation, automatic launch, upgrade compatibility, data retention and recovery using the pinned Docker/Compose/OS/client matrix. Document setup prerequisites, diagnosis, explicit stop and backup/restore without making runtime Docker socket access a general plugin capability.
2. P12-T09-AC02: Every named capability in the scope has a passing focused check or a recorded, unresolved environment/decision gap. A gap prevents this task being marked done; a smaller successful example cannot stand in for the entire scope.
3. P12-T09-AC03: Affected existing behavior has a baseline/candidate comparison or an approved behavior-change record; no capability, required assertion or stored identity is silently removed.
4. P12-T09-AC04: Evidence identifies the candidate commit, actual environment, command and result for each task criterion; secrets and private agent reasoning are excluded. Known limitations, migration and recovery behavior are documented.

### P12-GATE: Verify and accept P12

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P12-T01, P12-T02, P12-T03, P12-T04, P12-T05, P12-T06, P12-T07, P12-T08, P12-T09, P12-T10.

**Implementation plan**

1. Confirm every phase task and prerequisite is complete; inspect the actual deliverables and limitations rather than relying on a done label.
2. Run the phase's full acceptance, failure, preservation and rollback checks on the exact candidate and supported environments. Retain per-criterion evidence using gate-record.template.json.
3. Codex reviews actual deliverables and subagent findings and records the advancement decision. Parallelize bounded subagent work only within this phase. Missing evidence remains blocking; no human approval is required.
4. Commit all phase changes and evidence to feat/agentmux-platform-rearchitecture, push, and verify the remote commit. Record that commit before the next phase starts. MERGE-01 remains separate.
5. Preserve the assertions assigned to this task for AMX-BASE-006 in delivery/evidence/P00/baseline-findings.md. Re-run or port the actual fixtures at the changed authority boundary; preserve explicitly open broader acceptance requirements.

**Deliverables**

1. Release readiness dossier
2. Pilot and migration acceptance
3. Signed merge/release decision
4. Component reuse decisions, baseline/candidate results, gain evidence and approved exceptions for ADD-01

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P12-GATE-AC01: Every launch requirement is linked to passing evidence for the exact release candidate. Critical correctness/security defects are closed.
2. P12-GATE-AC02: A new developer installs and completes the reference task using only published docs on every supported platform.
3. P12-GATE-AC03: A team administrator enrolls two organizations, shares a scoped project, delegates work, survives a partition, and restores a backup.
4. P12-GATE-AC04: The approved capacity/SLO targets and recovery drill pass without losing acknowledged durable records within the tested fault model.
5. P12-GATE-AC05: Codex reviews release-readiness evidence and records provisional readiness plus all outstanding MERGE-01 requirements. P12 acceptance does not authorize merge or release; final branch acceptance requires every phase and safe bilateral orchestration between independently enrolled, agent-operated real hubs on the exact candidate.
6. P12-GATE-AC06: The approved NATS storage profile passes record/checkpoint/artifact restore, projection rebuild, retention-gap and migration rollback drills under the declared process/host/disk/quorum failure model. Published RPO/RTO and capacity claims match observed evidence, and no unreviewed SQL authority remains.
7. P12-GATE-AC07: Every component and behavior check has a reviewed release disposition. Required baseline/candidate comparisons and migration drills pass on the supported matrix; no skipped check, missing component or unapproved feature removal can be hidden by a successful new reference workflow.
8. P12-GATE-AC08: Fresh-user and upgrade drills pass LOCAL-01 cold/warm/concurrent startup, actionable Docker failures, explicit stop, persistent data recovery and scoped hub status on the supported platform/client matrix. No launch silently upgrades an incompatible live stack, loses durable work or bypasses a required phase gate.
9. P12-GATE-AC09: All assigned failure scenarios and component checks have reviewed evidence for the candidate; missing or skipped required checks remain blocking.
10. P12-GATE-AC10: The required reviewer and advancement decision are recorded, and the phase commit is verified on the current remote feature branch. No merge is performed.

**Verification**

1. Run the complete release matrix, independent security review, load/soak tests, upgrade/restore rehearsal, and pilot acceptance.
2. Compare evidence manifests to the exact candidate digest and invalidate stale results after material changes.
3. Review support and commercial readiness with accountable owners.
4. Run qualified storage failure and recovery drills with pinned disk/sync/replication settings, including capacity exhaustion. Verify restored reservations before processing queued commands.
5. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.
6. Repeat FAIL-55–FAIL-62 with the exact packaged release, real federation and each advertised launch integration; record readiness deadlines, versions, volume identity and observed timing.
7. Review MERGE-01 evidence completeness and remaining required phases. Rehearsals may happen here, but repeat the final run on the exact final branch candidate after all required phases pass.

## P13. Remaining Jev catalog and skill expansion

Every remaining research proposal receives a measured implementation decision.

**Epic acceptance criteria**

- **P13-AC01:** All 88 original uses, 14 video additions, four enablers, and 26 skills retain a traceable disposition and owning phase.
- **P13-AC02:** Each batch passes schema, access, failure, semantic holdout, host-capability, and end-to-end economic gates.
- **P13-AC03:** Compaction preserves mandatory obligations and active evidence and runs only on supported hosts.
- **P13-AC04:** No savings claim relies only on shortened context or a provider's confidence score. Outcome quality and total cost meet approved thresholds.
- **P13-AC05:** Every affected existing component retains its documented behavior through reused code or a justified replacement. Its baseline and candidate checks, migration checks, and added capability evidence are reviewed before advancement. Missing environments remain open. Codex reviews intended behavior and migration changes against the full user scope; autonomous delivery does not authorize capability removal, reduced scope or weaker verification.

### P13-T05: Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P12-GATE.

**Implementation plan**

1. Review the phase-owned components in the preservation matrix and identify every changed caller, command, route, state record, integration and UI action; also include cross-phase callers affected by this work.
2. Record retain/wrap/extract/extend/replace decisions with reasons. Map each old assertion and data identity to its target. Capture missing characterization fixtures before refactoring.
3. Run the available baseline checks and define the candidate, migration/rollback and added-functionality checks. Candidate execution belongs to the implementation and final phase gate, so this preparation does not depend on future code being finished.
4. Maintain the inventory and behavior ownership throughout the phase. Missing environments stay open. Codex reviews any capability change against the complete user-authorized scope; autonomy does not permit silent scope reduction.

**Deliverables**

1. Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller. Record reuse, intentional behavior changes, migration needs and the specific added functionality before editing implementation.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

### P13-JEV-003: Project and repository disambiguation

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P12-GATE, P13-T05.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the original proposal, related records, controls and evaluation gates preserved in sourceRecord. Identify shared implementations first; this record does not require a separate service, model call or additive savings claim.
2. Implement or extend a versioned definition/capability for: Project and repository disambiguation
3. Preserve the item's exact source boundary, permissions and required facts. Use deterministic checks before optional inference, scoped evidence/cache identities, explicit abstention and bounded time/cost. Keep the feature disabled or advisory until qualified.
4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P13-JEV-003-AC01: An ineligible or nonexistent option cannot be returned as an executable choice.
2. P13-JEV-003-AC02: Missing or inadequate candidates produce no-fit/unknown; exact routing/arithmetic uses code without an unnecessary Jev call.
3. P13-JEV-003-AC03: Preserve this item-specific boundary: Never expand project access; ambiguous targets require confirmation before effects.
4. P13-JEV-003-AC04: Report Wrong-project suggestions on representative untouched cases and complete accepted workflows, with baseline and failure slices.
5. P13-JEV-003-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
6. P13-JEV-003-AC06: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

**Verification**

1. Run the item's required evaluation gates: EVAL-CONTRACT, EVAL-SEMANTIC, EVAL-ECONOMICS

**Original proposal and item-specific boundaries**

### P13-JEV-005: Potential duplicate task discovery

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P12-GATE, P13-T05.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the original proposal, related records, controls and evaluation gates preserved in sourceRecord. Identify shared implementations first; this record does not require a separate service, model call or additive savings claim.
2. Implement or extend a versioned definition/capability for: Potential duplicate task discovery
3. Preserve the item's exact source boundary, permissions and required facts. Use deterministic checks before optional inference, scoped evidence/cache identities, explicit abstention and bounded time/cost. Keep the feature disabled or advisory until qualified.
4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P13-JEV-005-AC01: Distinguish wording-only edits from changed negation, scope, target, version or obligations using reviewed paired fixtures.
2. P13-JEV-005-AC02: Similarity never silently merges tasks/artifacts, cancels reservations, or rewrites authoritative instructions.
3. P13-JEV-005-AC03: Preserve this item-specific boundary: Similarity does not merge tasks, cancel work, or transfer reservations.
4. P13-JEV-005-AC04: Report Confirmed duplicates; false merges avoided on representative untouched cases and complete accepted workflows, with baseline and failure slices.
5. P13-JEV-005-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
6. P13-JEV-005-AC06: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P12-GATE, P13-T05.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the original proposal, related records, controls and evaluation gates preserved in sourceRecord. Identify shared implementations first; this record does not require a separate service, model call or additive savings claim.
2. Implement or extend a versioned definition/capability for: Approved tool-recipe selection
3. Preserve the item's exact source boundary, permissions and required facts. Use deterministic checks before optional inference, scoped evidence/cache identities, explicit abstention and bounded time/cost. Keep the feature disabled or advisory until qualified.
4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P13-JEV-020-AC01: An ineligible or nonexistent option cannot be returned as an executable choice.
2. P13-JEV-020-AC02: Missing or inadequate candidates produce no-fit/unknown; exact routing/arithmetic uses code without an unnecessary Jev call.
3. P13-JEV-020-AC03: Preserve this item-specific boundary: Jev selects existing code; it does not generate a script or authorize side effects.
4. P13-JEV-020-AC04: Report Roundtrips avoided; wrong recipe rate on representative untouched cases and complete accepted workflows, with baseline and failure slices.
5. P13-JEV-020-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
6. P13-JEV-020-AC06: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

3. Preserve the item's exact source boundary, permissions and required facts. Use deterministic checks before optional inference, scoped evidence/cache identities, explicit abstention and bounded time/cost. Keep the feature disabled or advisory until qualified.
4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P13-JEV-038-AC01: Mandatory lifecycle, failure, approval, ownership, completion, explicit user and addressed messages bypass suppression.
2. P13-JEV-038-AC02: Optional originals remain durable; delayed/grouped information preserves distinct concerns and stays within explicit time bounds.
3. P13-JEV-038-AC03: Preserve this item-specific boundary: Completion, approval, failure, and ownership events use deterministic delivery.
4. P13-JEV-038-AC04: Report Planner calls avoided; missed decisions on representative untouched cases and complete accepted workflows, with baseline and failure slices.
5. P13-JEV-038-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
6. P13-JEV-038-AC06: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P13-JEV-050-AC01: Seed supported, unsupported, contradictory and insufficient-evidence cases; report per-class confusion and independent evidence.
2. P13-JEV-050-AC02: A positive judgment cannot manufacture passing tests, verify a claim by repetition or waive the authoritative acceptance criteria.
3. P13-JEV-050-AC03: Preserve this item-specific boundary: Dependency graph and invalidation rules decide which artifacts must be rechecked.
4. P13-JEV-050-AC04: Report Rework scope and escaped regressions on representative untouched cases and complete accepted workflows, with baseline and failure slices.
5. P13-JEV-050-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
6. P13-JEV-050-AC06: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

### P13-JEV-061: Provider degradation classification

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P12-GATE, P13-T05.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the original proposal, related records, controls and evaluation gates preserved in sourceRecord. Identify shared implementations first; this record does not require a separate service, model call or additive savings claim.
2. Implement or extend a versioned definition/capability for: Provider degradation classification
3. Preserve the item's exact source boundary, permissions and required facts. Use deterministic checks before optional inference, scoped evidence/cache identities, explicit abstention and bounded time/cost. Keep the feature disabled or advisory until qualified.
4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

### P13-JEV-078: Evaluation-case prioritization

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P12-GATE, P13-T05.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the original proposal, related records, controls and evaluation gates preserved in sourceRecord. Identify shared implementations first; this record does not require a separate service, model call or additive savings claim.
2. Implement or extend a versioned definition/capability for: Evaluation-case prioritization
3. Preserve the item's exact source boundary, permissions and required facts. Use deterministic checks before optional inference, scoped evidence/cache identities, explicit abstention and bounded time/cost. Keep the feature disabled or advisory until qualified.
4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P13-JEV-078-AC01: Held-out labels/outcomes are absent from tested inputs; predictions and measured quality are separate artifacts.
2. P13-JEV-078-AC02: Sampling includes apparently successful and random cases; retained final holdout and prospective outcomes prevent circular promotion.
3. P13-JEV-078-AC03: Preserve this item-specific boundary: Keep random sampling too; avoid only labeling model-selected cases.
4. P13-JEV-078-AC04: Report Coverage of failure modes and label cost on representative untouched cases and complete accepted workflows, with baseline and failure slices.
5. P13-JEV-078-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.

1. P13-VIDEO-04-AC01: Changing content, relevant dependency, question, model, candidate order or access scope invalidates an affected judgment.
2. P13-VIDEO-04-AC02: Unchanged eligible entries reuse prior results without pretending to establish current correctness beyond the evaluated question.
3. P13-VIDEO-04-AC03: Preserve source boundary: Cache keys include content digest, question/rubric, model, relevant dependency state and access scope. Task-specific relevance cannot reuse a generic answer. Never use stale annotations as proof of current correctness.
4. P13-VIDEO-04-AC04: Measure Useful cache-hit rate; calls avoided; invalidation correctness; stale-answer incidents.
5. P13-VIDEO-04-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
6. P13-VIDEO-04-AC06: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

**Verification**

1. Run the item's required evaluation gates: EVAL-CONTRACT, EVAL-SEMANTIC, EVAL-ECONOMICS, EVAL-EVIDENCE

### P13-VIDEO-06: Adaptive compaction timing

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P12-GATE, P13-T05.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the original proposal, related records, controls and evaluation gates preserved in sourceRecord. Identify shared implementations first; this record does not require a separate service, model call or additive savings claim.
2. Implement or extend a versioned definition/capability for: Adaptive compaction timing
3. Preserve the item's exact source boundary, permissions and required facts. Use deterministic checks before optional inference, scoped evidence/cache identities, explicit abstention and bounded time/cost. Keep the feature disabled or advisory until qualified.
4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P13-VIDEO-06-AC01: Skip semantic evaluation when deterministic context or in-flight-operation checks already settle timing.
2. P13-VIDEO-06-AC02: On each supported host, checkpoint/compaction preserves required facts; unsupported native operations return advice only.
3. P13-VIDEO-06-AC03: Preserve source boundary: Use real client capabilities and thresholds calibrated to that agent. Enforce hard token limits, safe checkpoints and cooldowns in code. Jev does not write the summary. Unsupported external sessions receive advice rather than a promise of control.
4. P13-VIDEO-06-AC04: Measure Total context/compaction cost; recovery errors; repeated evidence reads; task quality.
5. P13-VIDEO-06-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
6. P13-VIDEO-06-AC06: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

<a id="P13-jev-compare"></a>

### P13-jev-compare: jev-compare

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P12-GATE, P13-T05.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the original proposal, related records, controls and evaluation gates preserved in sourceRecord. Identify shared implementations first; this record does not require a separate service, model call or additive savings claim.
2. Use the skill-creator workflow to author the declared trigger, inputs, outputs, use case, safe failure behavior and host-specific packaging: jev-compare
3. Preserve the item's exact source boundary, permissions and required facts. Use deterministic checks before optional inference, scoped evidence/cache identities, explicit abstention and bounded time/cost. Keep the feature disabled or advisory until qualified.
4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P13-jev-compare-AC01: Preserves hard constraints; explains factor evidence; computes weights exactly; does not favor polished prose without support.

4. Build item-specific positive, negative and near-miss fixtures, then an untouched holdout set. Test the listed acceptance criteria on each claimed host; mocks qualify mechanics only. Use capped live calls only with the required local credentials and budget authorization.
5. Compare the ordinary workflow, tools-only workflow and tools-plus-skill workflow where relevant. Record quality, accepted outcomes, downstream tokens, total billed cost, retries, latency and rework using the item's own metrics.
6. Record the implementation/disposition and evidence for this exact ID. A failed or uneconomic experiment stays tracked with its owner and next review point; it is not silently counted as shipped. Preserve any later expansion or remote qualification dependencies.

**Deliverables**

1. Versioned implementation or explicit evaluated disposition
2. Item-specific fixtures, holdout results and host/cost evidence

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P13-agentmux-jev-tune-policies-AC01: Permissions and required review are never weighted away; stale evidence is rejected; unknown counterfactual outcomes stay unknown.
2. P13-agentmux-jev-tune-policies-AC02: Suite-wide positive/near-miss/no-inference prompts choose the intended workflow without loading unrelated full skill bodies.
3. P13-agentmux-jev-tune-policies-AC03: Paired ordinary-workflow/tools-only/tools-plus-skill results meet declared quality targets on an untouched release set for each supported host.
4. P13-agentmux-jev-tune-policies-AC04: Sources, tools and provider failures retain scope, outcome and evidence semantics; no silent direct-provider or native-hook fallback.
5. P13-agentmux-jev-tune-policies-AC05: All required controls and evaluation gates in sourceRecord have explicit evidence; unknown or failed results prevent default activation.
6. P13-agentmux-jev-tune-policies-AC06: Related records retain their IDs and shared implementation links; no overlapping benefit is counted twice.

**Verification**

1. Run the item's required evaluation gates: EVAL-CONTRACT, EVAL-SKILL, EVAL-SEMANTIC, EVAL-ECONOMICS, EVAL-HOST

### P13-GATE: Verify and accept P13

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P13-T01, P13-T02, P13-T03, P13-T04, P13-T05, P13-JEV-003, P13-JEV-005, P13-JEV-006, P13-JEV-007, P13-JEV-009, P13-JEV-011, P13-JEV-012, P13-JEV-013, P13-JEV-014, P13-JEV-018, P13-JEV-020, P13-JEV-022, P13-JEV-028, P13-JEV-029, P13-JEV-030, P13-JEV-033, P13-JEV-035, P13-JEV-036, P13-JEV-037, P13-JEV-038, P13-JEV-039, P13-JEV-040, P13-JEV-041, P13-JEV-042, P13-JEV-045, P13-JEV-046, P13-JEV-047, P13-JEV-048, P13-JEV-050, P13-JEV-051, P13-JEV-052, P13-JEV-053, P13-JEV-054, P13-JEV-055, P13-JEV-057, P13-JEV-058, P13-JEV-059, P13-JEV-060, P13-JEV-061, P13-JEV-062, P13-JEV-063, P13-JEV-064, P13-JEV-066, P13-JEV-067, P13-JEV-075, P13-JEV-076, P13-JEV-077, P13-JEV-078, P13-JEV-079, P13-JEV-080, P13-JEV-081, P13-JEV-082, P13-JEV-083, P13-JEV-085, P13-JEV-087, P13-VIDEO-04, P13-VIDEO-06, P13-VIDEO-07, P13-VIDEO-09, P13-VIDEO-10, P13-VIDEO-13, P13-VIDEO-14, P13-jev-extract, P13-jev-compare, P13-jev-checkpoint, P13-jev-integrate, P13-jev-optimize, P13-agentmux-jev-plan, P13-agentmux-jev-coordinate, P13-agentmux-jev-diagnose-run, P13-agentmux-jev-curate-knowledge, P13-agentmux-jev-review-plugin, P13-agentmux-jev-tune-policies.

**Implementation plan**

1. Confirm every phase task and prerequisite is complete; inspect the actual deliverables and limitations rather than relying on a done label.
2. Run the phase's full acceptance, failure, preservation and rollback checks on the exact candidate and supported environments. Retain per-criterion evidence using gate-record.template.json.
3. Codex reviews actual deliverables and subagent findings and records the advancement decision. Parallelize bounded subagent work only within this phase. Missing evidence remains blocking; no human approval is required.
4. Commit all phase changes and evidence to feat/agentmux-platform-rearchitecture, push, and verify the remote commit. Record that commit before the next phase starts. MERGE-01 remains separate.

**Deliverables**

1. Catalog disposition register
2. Per-batch holdout and economics
3. Complete skill-suite release matrix
4. Component reuse decisions, baseline/candidate results, gain evidence and approved exceptions for ADD-01

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P13-GATE-AC01: All 88 original uses, 14 video additions, four enablers, and 26 skills retain a traceable disposition and owning phase.
2. P13-GATE-AC02: Each batch passes schema, access, failure, semantic holdout, host-capability, and end-to-end economic gates.
3. P13-GATE-AC03: Compaction preserves mandatory obligations and active evidence and runs only on supported hosts.
4. P13-GATE-AC04: No savings claim relies only on shortened context or a provider's confidence score. Outcome quality and total cost meet approved thresholds.
5. P13-GATE-AC05: Every affected existing component retains its documented behavior through reused code or a justified replacement. Its baseline and candidate checks, migration checks, and added capability evidence are reviewed before advancement. Missing environments remain open. Codex reviews intended behavior and migration changes against the full user scope; autonomous delivery does not authorize capability removal, reduced scope or weaker verification.
6. P13-GATE-AC06: All assigned failure scenarios and component checks have reviewed evidence for the candidate; missing or skipped required checks remain blocking.
7. P13-GATE-AC07: The required reviewer and advancement decision are recorded, and the phase commit is verified on the current remote feature branch. No merge is performed.

**Verification**

1. Repeat the P08/P09 evaluation protocol per changed definition/skill and representative combined workflows.
2. Use stored factors for policy-only replay and record when a fresh inference is necessary.
3. Run regression tests for cache isolation, missing evidence, mandatory messages, provider failure, and decision drift.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

## P14. Sandboxed plugins and ecosystem expansion

Untrusted third-party plugins gain a tested containment option.

**Epic acceptance criteria**

- **P14-AC01:** Adversarial plugins fail to escape their declared profile or access unauthorized host/team data in the supported threat model.
- **P14-AC02:** Sandboxed and trusted implementations pass the same language-neutral domain contract tests.
- **P14-AC03:** Required native/device integrations declare and enforce narrower support or an explicitly trusted execution host.
- **P14-AC04:** Security review and per-platform tests pass before claiming untrusted-plugin support. Marketplace availability requires this gate or a clearly restricted trusted catalog.
- **P14-AC05:** Every affected existing component retains its documented behavior through reused code or a justified replacement. Its baseline and candidate checks, migration checks, and added capability evidence are reviewed before advancement. Missing environments remain open. Codex reviews intended behavior and migration changes against the full user scope; autonomous delivery does not authorize capability removal, reduced scope or weaker verification.

### P14-T01: Choose and threat-model isolated execution profiles, process/container/WASM options, host brokers, and platform limitations against actual plugin needs.

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P13-GATE, P14-T05.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Choose and threat-model isolated execution profiles, process/container/WASM options, host brokers, and platform limitations against actual plugin needs.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.
5. Attach the resulting artifacts and source-bound evidence. Update affected pattern and component records. Hand the result to the phase verification task without claiming the whole phase is accepted.

**Deliverables**

1. Choose and threat-model isolated execution profiles, process/container/WASM options, host brokers, and platform limitations against actual plugin needs.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P14-T01-AC01: The scoped deliverable is implemented or, for a decision/review item, explicitly decided with alternatives and consequences: Choose and threat-model isolated execution profiles, process/container/WASM options, host brokers, and platform limitations against actual plugin needs.
2. P14-T01-AC02: Every named capability in the scope has a passing focused check or a recorded, unresolved environment/decision gap. A gap prevents this task being marked done; a smaller successful example cannot stand in for the entire scope.
3. P14-T01-AC03: Affected existing behavior has a baseline/candidate comparison or an approved behavior-change record; no capability, required assertion or stored identity is silently removed.
4. P14-T01-AC04: Evidence identifies the candidate commit, actual environment, command and result for each task criterion; secrets and private agent reasoning are excluded. Known limitations, migration and recovery behavior are documented.

**Verification**

1. Run exploit-oriented confinement, resource exhaustion, cross-tenant, lifecycle, dependency, and upgrade tests on each supported profile.
2. Review residual risk and performance/compatibility effects with independent security expertise.
3. Re-run representative local, team, federation, UI, and industrial workflows.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

### P14-T04: Retain trusted native profiles only with clear administrator choice

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P13-GATE, P14-T05.

**Implementation plan**

1. Inspect the existing source and callers for this exact work item: Retain trusted native profiles only with clear administrator choice. Assess future hosted service and native Windows as separate product decisions.
2. Record inputs, outputs, authority, failure states and compatibility constraints for this scope. Use the phase's approved contracts; resolve any blocking design decision before changing its implementation.
3. Implement the scoped work in a reviewable slice behind existing entry points where compatible. Preserve legacy assertions, stable IDs, data relationships and user configuration; record a justified replacement or migration where reuse is insufficient.
4. Add or reuse focused fixtures for the successful path and the applicable denial, malformed input, retry, cancellation and crash boundaries. Start with the smallest failing test, then run affected integration checks.

### P14-T05: Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P13-GATE.

**Implementation plan**

1. Review the phase-owned components in the preservation matrix and identify every changed caller, command, route, state record, integration and UI action; also include cross-phase callers affected by this work.
2. Record retain/wrap/extract/extend/replace decisions with reasons. Map each old assertion and data identity to its target. Capture missing characterization fixtures before refactoring.
3. Run the available baseline checks and define the candidate, migration/rollback and added-functionality checks. Candidate execution belongs to the implementation and final phase gate, so this preparation does not depend on future code being finished.
4. Maintain the inventory and behavior ownership throughout the phase. Missing environments stay open. Codex reviews any capability change against the complete user-authorized scope; autonomy does not permit silent scope reduction.

**Deliverables**

1. Apply ADD-01 and the component preservation matrix to every changed source file and affected caller. Record reuse, intentional behavior changes, migration needs and the specific added functionality before editing implementation.
2. Focused regression evidence and affected compatibility/migration records

**Acceptance criteria**

1. P14-T05-AC01: Every phase-owned component and affected cross-phase caller has a recorded scope, existing behavior and owner; no changed source is unmapped.
2. P14-T05-AC02: Baseline evidence distinguishes passing, failing, unavailable and historical results. Any gap that prevents a safe planned change remains blocking.
3. P14-T05-AC03: Reuse and migration decisions name alternatives, preserved IDs/assertions and rollback boundaries; required approval exists before any capability reduction.
4. P14-T05-AC04: Candidate comparison, added-functionality and migration fixtures are assigned to implementation and phase verification tasks. This preflight does not claim that future candidate tests already passed.

**Verification**

1. Run exploit-oriented confinement, resource exhaustion, cross-tenant, lifecycle, dependency, and upgrade tests on each supported profile.
2. Review residual risk and performance/compatibility effects with independent security expertise.
3. Re-run representative local, team, federation, UI, and industrial workflows.
4. Run the component coverage validator, review newly added or changed entry points, and attach the owning component checks to the phase gate. Compare existing and candidate behavior in isolated environments; do not run old and new writers against the same live records.

2. Run the phase's full acceptance, failure, preservation and rollback checks on the exact candidate and supported environments. Retain per-criterion evidence using gate-record.template.json.
3. Codex reviews actual deliverables and subagent findings and records the advancement decision. Parallelize bounded subagent work only within this phase. Missing evidence remains blocking; no human approval is required.
4. Commit all phase changes and evidence to feat/agentmux-platform-rearchitecture, push, and verify the remote commit. Record that commit before the next phase starts. MERGE-01 remains separate.

**Deliverables**

1. Sandbox threat model and test report
2. Profile compatibility matrix
3. Ecosystem launch decision
4. Component reuse decisions, baseline/candidate results, gain evidence and approved exceptions for ADD-01

Codex reviews intended behavior and migration changes against the full user scope; autonomous delivery does not authorize capability removal, reduced scope or weaker verification.
6. P14-GATE-AC06: All assigned failure scenarios and component checks have reviewed evidence for the candidate; missing or skipped required checks remain blocking.
7. P14-GATE-AC07: The required reviewer and advancement decision are recorded, and the phase commit is verified on the current remote feature branch. No merge is performed.

**Verification**

1. Run exploit-oriented confinement, resource exhaustion, cross-tenant, lifecycle, dependency, and upgrade tests on each supported profile.

### MERGE-01: Autonomous final feature-branch acceptance and verified push

**Status:** planned. **Owner:** Codex.

**Dependencies:** P00-GATE, P01-GATE, P02-GATE, P03-GATE, P04-GATE, P05-GATE, P06-GATE, P07-GATE, P08-GATE, P09-GATE, P10-GATE, P11-GATE, P12-GATE, P13-GATE, P14-GATE.

**Implementation plan**

1. Verify every approved phase against the exact candidate and supported environments; collect the phase-by-phase evidence index and resolve every required gap.
2. Use agent-operated, independently enrolled running hubs with distinct administration identities. Demonstrate automatic Compose start and reuse, instance identity, readiness and scoped hub status.
3. Connect those hubs with explicit scoped grants. Run the plan's read-only fixture orchestration in both directions, with origin-owned acceptance in each direction.
4. Preserve fixture checksums, artifact digests, task/delegation/attempt/result identities and terminal/dashboard observations. Verify bounded outputs and unchanged inputs; rerun affected checks after material changes.
5. Codex reviews the actual evidence and subagent findings, records its dated final acceptance of this exact candidate and verifies the pushed feature-branch commit. Record mergeAuthorized=false; this acceptance never permits a merge.

**Deliverables**

1. Completed final acceptance record and linked real-instance evidence
2. Dated Codex review, verified remote commit and mergeAuthorized=false

**Acceptance criteria**

1. MERGE-01-AC01: Every required P00–P14 criterion and environment has reviewed, current evidence with no unresolved required gap.
2. MERGE-01-AC02: Two agent-operated, independently enrolled real hubs complete the non-destructive orchestration in both directions, including explicit origin acceptance.
3. MERGE-01-AC03: The complete finalMergeGate evidence bundle identifies the exact candidate, scopes, operations, artifacts, checksums and before/after observations.
4. MERGE-01-AC04: Codex reviews that evidence and accepts the exact candidate after verifying the remote feature-branch commit. No human review is required and no merge is authorized.

**Verification**

1. Execute every step of implementation-plan.md, MERGE-01, on the final candidate.
