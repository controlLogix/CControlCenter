# Share the visual review with Nick

Send **[agentmux-visual-review.html](../agentmux-visual-review.html)**. It is about 13 MB and contains all six concept images, explanations, review questions, styling, scripts and a downloadable copy of the implementation plan. Nick does not need this repository or any other file to read the visual review.

1. Download the HTML attachment to a local folder.
2. Open it in a browser. No web server or internet connection is needed.
3. Use the numbered navigation to reach a scene, and **Enlarge image** to inspect its detail.
4. Add comments beneath the images and in **Your review notes**.
5. Choose **Download notes (.md)** and send that downloaded file back to Ryan. If no download appears, use **Show notes as text** and copy the result.

Notes stay on the reviewer's computer. Browser draft storage is best-effort, especially for files opened from disk. The HTML sent to Nick starts with empty note fields; it does not contain someone else's saved browser draft. The embedded implementation plan is an exact source Markdown copy; its repository-relative references still refer to files in the repository.

These are concept images with sample data. Review notes do not approve implementation, a phase gate or a merge.

## Design and checks

Claude Opus 5.5 authored the layout, styling, scene renderer, image viewer and local notes interactions through the user-requested Ubuntu WSL terminal. Codex prepared the content, packaged the embedded assets and reviewed the result. See [design provenance](design-provenance.json) for the session and the three integration corrections.

The [verification record](verification.json) reports three passing component tests, JavaScript syntax checks, valid local anchors and form labels, six unchanged embedded PNGs, an exact embedded plan, and no external resource references or network calls in the page script. Browser inspection was not completed: the browser tool's policy rejected the local file URL. Static checks do not establish rendered layout or browser interaction correctness.

The six baseline defects now have [verified runtime repairs](../governance-repairs.md) and preserved governance history. The rebuilt HTML embeds the current plan, including that limited progress. Its concept screens remain future designs; the HTML does not establish complete phase or product acceptance.

## Rebuild

From the repository root:

```text
node docs/planning/2026-10-09/review-site/src/pages/build.mjs
node --test docs/planning/2026-10-09/review-site/src/components/organisms/Scene/Scene.test.mjs
```

Edit the source template, feature script, Scene component or `scenes.json`, then rebuild. Do not edit the generated HTML directly. The [build report](build-report.json) records its size, checksum and embedded source hashes.
