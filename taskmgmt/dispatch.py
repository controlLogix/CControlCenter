"""Dispatch: turning a board card into a running agent, and back again.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The board could say what was ready and agentmux could run an agent, and nothing
joined the two. So "use the task board" meant a person reading the queue, picking
a card, typing `spawn`, typing `claim`, pasting a brief, and remembering to move
the status. Every one of those is a step a machine should take, and every one of
them got skipped under load - which is how a board full of startable work came to
sit next to three idle agents.

This module is that join and nothing more. It does not decide what is ready:
`/api/board/dispatchable` does, because readiness is board policy and a dispatcher
that re-derived it would be a second opinion able to disagree with the gates. It
does not run agents: `agentmux spawn` does. It owns exactly the sequence between
them, and the sequence back.

THE SEQUENCE, AND WHY IT IS THIS ORDER
--------------------------------------
    spawn -> claim -> start -> brief

Claiming before spawning is impossible: a claim must be held by a LIVE agent
(coordination.resolve_identity), and a name nobody has spawned is not live.
Briefing before claiming is too late: the agent is already reading the card. So
the worker is spawned, claims its files while still sitting at an empty prompt,
and is briefed only once those files are actually its own. If a claim is refused,
the worker is killed and the card is left exactly as it was found.

`start` goes through the board's own gate. This module never writes a status it
has decided is allowed - it asks, and a refusal (HTTP 409) is the answer rather
than an error to route around. That is why an unready card cannot be dispatched
even by calling this directly: the gate is not in this file.

WHAT COLLECT DOES NOT DO
------------------------
It never closes a task. A worker that finished is a worker that CLAIMS to have
finished, and `requireOnDone` wants evidence and an actor. Collect reconciles the
world - releases claims, reaps the pane, parks what died - and leaves the closing
judgement to the gate, the only thing entitled to make it.
