"""CLI profiles: what a given agent CLI's screen means. See docs/TRANSPORT.md section 3.

A profile knows nothing about tmux. It reads screen TEXT (already ANSI-stripped) and
answers: is it ready for input, is it busy, is a modal showing and what is the safe
answer, is something sitting unsubmitted in the input box.

Ported from agentmux.sh (modal_text / modal_answer / modal_decision / busy_marker)
and clear-modals.sh, which are the record of what each CLI actually showed.
