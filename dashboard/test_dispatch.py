"""Verify the dispatch seam: what may be handed to an agent, and in what order.

    python3 dashboard/test_dispatch.py   # no network, no tmux, no port 8787

Runs against a throwaway AGENTMUX_HOME under the system temp directory, so it
never touches the operator's cc.db or starts an agent. Git lifecycle checks use
a temporary repository and real git subprocesses.

WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
----------------------
`dispatchable` is the only thing standing between a board and a machine that
starts unrestricted agents against this repository. Four properties matter more
than the rest, and each has a named check:

  * AN UNREADY CARD IS NEVER OFFERED. Not merely "not started" - not offered, so
    a dispatcher cannot start one even by asking for it by name.
  * A CARD RESERVED FOR A PERSON IS NEVER OFFERED. NOT_FOR_AGENTS exists because
    some cards are a decision, and a well-specified decision is still not work an
    agent may take.
  * THE EPIC IS RESOLVED BEFORE READINESS IS JUDGED. _payload_task leaves `epic`
    as None and only board() fills it in; agent_readiness asks for it. The first
    version of this read used _payload_task raw, so on a board with requireEpic
    set - which is the default - EVERY card read as epic-less and the queue was
    permanently empty. It looked like "nothing is ready" rather than a bug, which
    is the kind of failure that survives for weeks.
  * OVERLAPPING WORK RANKS LAST, AND IS STILL OFFERED. Two agents editing one
    file is what claims make safe and disjointness makes rare. A board whose every
    card touches the same file must still drain, one at a time.
